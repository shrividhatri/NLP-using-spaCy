After a few uses and exerting heavy pressure during mopping the handle clip is pushed open and will not close enough to secure the mop head any more. Maybe if you are dainty and don't push down on it the attachment will last longer, but I'm 6'3 and 225 lbs, and I was just trying to clean my kitchen floor.

Once I got everything together and solution filled, nothing happened when pulling the trigger. I thought maybe I had done something wrong but after doing some research I found that I in fact must have gotten a defective one. So the following day my husband exchanged it for a new one. Again, excited and hopeful this one would work, it's been nothing but trouble. The handle is always sticking and I have to pop the solution bottle out and back in just to get a few squirts out at a time. Then finally the other day while cleaning, I noticed a huge puddle where the mop was and it was all the solution I had in the bottle. Not sure how or why it leaked out the way it did, but it is no longer holding it.

("Quick Review: Rubbermaid Reveal Spray Mop. Was a toss-up between this or the competition. This one won out because it was less in my immiediate area. Actual use. Once I got the plastic off and the cardboard off the head, filling the bottle was easy. I used ZEP floor cleaner in the bottle ((filled bottle 3/4 full and still had 1/4 bottle left when done - put in spray bottle after) I'm not sure how many sq.ft of hardwood is in my place.... maybe 1,000+ (bedrooms, livingroom, dining area, hallway, bedroom, computer room, tv room, part of basement room). Vacuumed all areas before using the mop (good thing, one area I forgot to vacuum- had to deal with wet lint). Took longer having to move some furniture than mopping/polishing the floor. Spray...clean area, Move to next area...spray, repeat. Pad just glided over the floor. Stuck nicely to the velcro on the head without curling or peeling off as I went over the floor. If it looked too wet, just went over it a few more times. First time in years the floor has gotten a good polish, usually spot-clean and vacuum only ((have you ever tried cleaning 1,000 sq.ft of hardwood with a spray bottle and a microfibre cloth that keeps bunching up) Once all the floors were done, just peeled the microfibre head off (still to be washed, will wash with next load of rags I think and hang dry). You need to get a good grip to peel this off, I like that.

("Let me first preface that I HATE mopping. Did I tell you I hate mopping The thought of sticking my hand in dirty water wringing out the mop makes me shudder. Hence, I have been using the disposable wet mop system prior to installing laminate flooring. However, since the wet mop pads are oversaturated, they are not compatible with laminate flooring which pretty much has to be almost dry-mopped. I was instructed by the laminate installers to spray my itty-bitty microfiber mop and then proceed to clean my floor with a special hardwood and laminate cleaner repeating the steps too many times over 1000 sq feet of laminate flooring. After mopping this way a few times, I gave up and started just spot-cleaning the dirty areas. As a result, the floor was looking a bit dirty and hazy with paw prints, foot prints and goodness-knows-what-those-spots were despite hand-and-knee mopping. However, when I saw the Rubbermaid with a LARGE washable microfiber mop with attached spray, I knew I had to get it. Beware that the bottle top needs a lot of rinsing with warm water and repeated pushing in at the center of the spring top in order loosen its grip and easily spray after priming it for well over 30 sprays. I managed to mop my entire house in less than 30 minutes with the floor as clean as the day that it was installed. The just-mopped area dried quickly leaving a nice clean sheen. The Rubbermaid Reveal Spray made mopping a breeze from start to finish with me throwing the dirty mop head into the washer to be cleaned.

The mop itself is sturdy and attractive, easy to maneuver, and has a much wider path than any other brands I've used. My only problems were: wide and high spray path (GOOD) would sometimes spray on furniture (BAD). I remedied this by flipping the handle around and spraying the floor BEHIND the mop, instead this worked fine, but was a little tedious, as well as a little harder to pull on the trigger.) The solution bottles seemed to leak a little with each change-out, as well as when held upside down, but no biggie--I'm using people-safe cleaning solutions, after all. I had to be careful not to set the mop down on my berber area rugs--the plastic hooks that hold the pads in place wreaked havoc on them!

("I've been using the Reveal Mop since it came out. With 4 dogs and 3 (now 5) cats, keeping the floor clean with the rival brand was just too expensive. I have more than one- kitchen, bathroom and upstairs. I like being able to buy multiple cleaning heads, including a microfiber dust mop one. I have had problems with the sprayer on a couple and the trigger doesn't always work correctly. I've had one that just didn't work at all. So when they offered to let me try out one of the new ones, I readily agreed. I noticed immediately that the new one did not have an adjustable hook to hang with. The one on the new one is static, which makes it difficult to hang it where I have it. (If you store the mop after using it so that the pad can dry, you can extend the use of it. Don't let it set on the floor while wet) The scrubber is good for small jobs but I tend to pull out my Rubbermaid Spray Scrubber for the tough spots. I don't feel that the handle on the Reveal can stand up to the scrubbing I need to give the tiles, and the scrubber isn't big enough for my needs all the time. I also have not found replacement scrubbers yet. Washing the heads is simple (no fabric softner and hang to dry) and keeping bottles of separate cleaning products is handy. I have been using it for a while, and have noticed that I am having trigger issues occasionally. Not enough to deter me though. The minor problems/issues that I have with the Reveal has not deterred me from buying one for our RV. All in all it's still a great product, although I suggest not pushing too hard on the handle. For me, Rubbermaid is still one of the best products out there and I look forward to new products when they come out. As a side note, I recently threw out the Rubbermaid Desk I had bought my daughter back when they first came out, 20 years or so ago. The legs fell apart, but I still have the top of it, that I use across tow saw horses when I'm replanting in my garden. Then I can just hose it off.

("I've been using the Reveal Mop since it came out. With 4 dogs and 3 (now 5) cats, keeping the floor clean with the rival brand was just too expensive. I have more than one- kitchen, bathroom and upstairs. I like being able to buy multiple cleaning heads, including a microfiber dust mop one. I have had problems with the sprayer on a couple and the trigger doesn't always work correctly. I've had one that just didn't work at all. So when they offered to let me try out one of the new ones, I readily agreed. I noticed immediately that the new one did not have an adjustable hook to hang with. The one on the new one is static, which makes it difficult to hang it where I have it. (If you store the mop after using it so that the pad can dry, you can extend the use of it. Don't let it set on the floor while wet) The scrubber is good for small jobs but I tend to pull out my Rubbermaid Spray Scrubber for the tough spots. I don't feel that the handle on the Reveal can stand up to the scrubbing I need to give the tiles, and the scrubber isn't big enough for my needs all the time. I also have not found replacement scrubbers yet. Washing the heads is simple (no fabric softner and hang to dry) and keeping bottles of separate cleaning products is handy. I have been using it for a while, and have noticed that I am having trigger issues occasionally. Not enough to deter me though. The minor problems/issues that I have with the Reveal has not deterred me from buying one for our RV. All in all it's still a great product, although I suggest not pushing too hard on the handle. For me, Rubbermaid is still one of the best products out there and I look forward to new products when they come out. As a side note, I recently threw out the Rubbermaid Desk I had bought my daughter back when they first came out, 20 years or so ago.

I like the scrub pad feature and the new silicone loop to hang the mop. Nice improvement from the cheaper looking metal loop. I think the trigger spray feature is working better, as well. I had two old mops that died after only a couple of months of use - the trigger stopped connecting to the bottle to spray. So far, no issues with weak spraying or the trigger getting tired when in use. I use this to mop hardwood floors and my tile bathroom floors, so usage is about once per week.

("I recently tried and liked Juice Beauty Blemish Clearing Mask, 2 fl. oz. so I was very curious to try this product. First, it is worth noting that this is sunscreen, not just lotion that happens to have SPF in it. I say this because the name initially threw me off since it is called moisturizer and not sunscreen. But from reading the packing and applying it is definitely sunscreen. I say this because I regularly buy both and while lotion with SPF is my go-to on a day to day basis it's usually not waterproof enough or applied in a large enough quantity to provide adequate protection if you're wearing a bathing suit.First, I'll start with what I like about the product. I like that it is waterproof for 80 minutes. I also like that it is natural.That said, I'm not sure this product is meant for my needs. First, it has a very pungent smell. Admittedly, I tend to be sensitive to smells so if you are not, you may find yourself less bothered by the scent. But I had my boyfriend, who is less sensitive to smells than I am, try it and he too found the smell strong and unpleasant. It reminded me a lot of household cleaner, which I wasn't expecting since the other Juice Beauty product I've used has no scent at all. It also seems to sting my sensitive skin a bit. I wasn't expecting that because again, I've really liked the other Juice Beauty product I tried.It's also quite thick. I got this with the intention of using it on my face, but it feels too heavy. It also gives no indication of whether it is appropriate for acne prone skin so I'm a bit nervous it could clog my pores. Because of that, it seems more appropriate for my body, though functionally I have an easier time applying sunscreen with a spray.Based on my experience, this just isn't the sunscreen for me. While it's not natural, I've been much happier with Neutrogena Clear Face Break Out Free Liquid Lotion Sunscreen SPF 55 - 3 oz (Pack of 2).", {'entities': [(27, 39, 'PRODUCT')]})
("The word moisturizer seems a bit misleading here. While I absolutely love Juice Beauty (I use their face-wash, eye creme, moisturizer, everything!), this is a rare miss (for me).

Nonetheless, this would come somewhere around the lower-middle of the list for its messiness, difficulty of application, and odor. Likewise, the bottle is pretty small. So, if you are like me and apply this to your arms, legs, and face, you may find yourself being a little disappointed at how quickly the tube disappears.The organic/natural angle had me hopeful.

("As I write this in November in the Midwest, I can't really speak to the sunscreen performance of this Juice Beauty SPF 30 Sport Sunscreen. I'll take the manufacturer at their word that it will perform as an SPF 30 protectant.Claims, including reviewers ravings, of wonderful organic fundamentals notwithstanding . . . the product derives it sun screening protection from good old zinc oxide (20), just like nearly all the other sunscreen creams, lotions, and sprays. The organic/mineral/natural marketing milieu regards only the carrier crme which likely does have beneficial moisturizing and rejuvenating properties. The tube indicates that this is Certified Organic.How do I like it As I said, I assume it does provide SPF 30 protection. The 3.75 oz tube is a convenient take along size which I prefer to the harder to carrier jumbo tubes and bottles offered elsewhere. Directions advise to shake before using. Do that.The crme is skin toned (Caucasian anyway). Helps prevent that white look, but can also stain white clothing. Odor is interesting. Not that familiar coconut tropical odor you get poolside on the cruise ship (which I like, by the way). This is more an earthy scent with a hint of citrus. Not disagreeable, but very different from the herd.I don't care for the texture of the residue after application. It feels like a powder which was suspended in grease. It hangs around -- not powdery, not greasy . . . or maybe it's both. Either way, it's annoying and seems to not want to go away. On the upside, it does indeed seem to moisturize and nourish the skin. And it does not wash off easily.In summary, an effective zinc oxide sunscreen that is different from the pack. Organic ingredients. Earthy scent. Annoying texture. Moisturizes effectively.", {'entities': [(102, 114, 'PRODUCT')]})

Additional moisturizer might be required for those who have extremely dry skin but overall it is a great product for me, has not broken my acne prone skin out.Additional it can go on as a primer and dries nice and smooth. The matte finish lasts for at least six hours so I don't have to worry about oil shine. My only suggestion is to give it a few moments to set before you add a liquid foundation as the matte finish will absorb the moisture from your foundation and make it harder to glide on.

That sent me off to an allergist, who gave me a list of ingredients to avoid, leaving me with very limited choices.The safest sunscreen for many with contact allergies is plain old zinc oxide. The problem with zinc, though, is one of appearances - it turns your skin white. (Or purple, or whatever color is added to the white.)The Juice Beauty is tinted ivory-beige. On my fair/easy-to-burn skin, it virtually disappears, soothing and creamy with no greasiness and no allergic reaction.The scent is a little weird, and very similar to Juice Beauty Nutrient Moisturizer, 2 fl. oz., just stronger smelling.

However, with some gentle reinforcement onto your face, the white tint will minimize. (I understand some individuals do not favor the thick, white finish, but I have made it work for me). I also appreciate that once applied to my skin, I feel satisfied that is does not easily rub off onto clothes (through changing sessions).

Reviewing the specs, I found them as good or better in most regards to the others, even the most expensive ones, and they included active noise cancellation. Since I was about to travel, this elevated these to near the top. The sale price and reviews pushed them over the top. I've been into high end audio for a long time. I like neutral sounding speakers so that the music sounds as it's supposed to. I paired these to my Galaxy S7 Edge, which was another reason I purchased these. These fit the bill. They are neutral sounding with good seperation and location of sound field (when the sound travels from one side to the other). There's a bit if reduction as it travels to right through the center but you have to be listening for it for it to stand out. Noise cancellation is acceptable. It helps out a bit but not as much as I expected. I read a review that said they thought it was about 80% improvement. I think it's lower, more like 60-70%. Although one of the reasons I purchased these was the noise canceling, I would not recommend these if noise canceling was the primary reason you want headphones. Although I have not experienced many others, they failed to meet my expectations in this regard. An important note, I was listening to an audiobook on the plane and there was a metallic, digital artifact happening. I couldn't figure out what was happening. I turned the noise cancellation on and off, repaired the headset, turned the phone on and off and various other attempts at fixing the issue to no avail. I finally figured out the was a high definition audio setting that is on the S7 that was supposed to smooth out the audio and create a less digital sounding experience. However, this Samsung setting does not work with the Samsung headphones. Really Samsung? You could not get one of your premium phones to work with one of your premium headphones with your premium settings? As for battery life, this exceeded my expectations. I've found the battery life listed usually is aspirational for the product. However, the listed life of of 10 hours is pretty accurate when used with, for me, lots of phone time (around 1.5-2 hours) and audio the remainder of time. It lasted around 12 hours at work just listening to audio on and off a bit.Overall the sound quality, battery life, and noise cancelling make these a good buy.

("Kiss Everlasting French Nails. I have tried press on nails before and have never been to impressed by them. They fall off, look cheap and you can tell you didn't go to a nail salon for them. I'm sad to say that I haven't even painted my nails since I had my daughter in February. My nails have been nice though. Have the press on nails is like a little treat for me. I just feel better when my nails are done or painted! They were quick and simple to apply just find the right size apply the glue press and hold then snap off the little number tab and you're good to go. They look great, not cheap and took minutes to apply rather than a long time in the salon. Now it may just be that I didn't sit long enough before I started doing stuff with them but I did have two pop over that I had to reapply. They were easily out back on though and I haven't had any come off since.", {'entities': [(0, 4, 'PRODUCT')]})
("I've been a fan of Kiss' press-on products for a few years now so I was really excited to try their Everlasting French kit when I received it as a sample from Influenster. Since it was my first time using a glue-on style fake nail there was a bit of a learning curve but I managed to have both hands done in under 15 minutes and man did they look gorgeous! The main issue I was having was knowing just how much glue each nail needed to set properly. For the first few fingers I had enough to make them stick but you could see if you looked at them closely that there were parts where no glue was. This also became a problem the next day when my 4 year old had a tantrum in a store and as I went to pick her up she caught one and it ripped off right there in the store. Ouch!!! After a day wearing them though I found that because my natural nails are VERY flat my fingers were all very sore from the pressure of the nails trying to lay curved. So I went and bought some acetone polish remover and spent the better part of an hour (we were watching a movie and it took more than 2/3 of it to get them and all the glue off). It was not my idea of easy at all. Not to mention the fact that it was extremely messy. So overall, while these are awesome looking and will last for days they might not be for flat fingered types or those who don't want to spend an hour getting them off. I would, however, highly recommend them for special occasions like weddings or as a budget friendly alternative to going to the salon for those who don't mind the removal process.", {'entities': [(19, 23, 'PRODUCT')]})

("I got the Kiss Everlasting Real Short Length French Nails, Pearl White Tip courtesy of Influenster and their SpringVoxBox. When I first got them, my initial impression was meh. I usually get my nails done at a salon and have never considered any of these home kits. After opening the package and reading the instructions, my first thoughts were that: 1. it seemed like an easy process to to put on. 2. I liked that there were multiple sizes. 3. They were soft and flexible (looked like it would fit the nail well) I decided to try them on immediately and wow! --they were definitely easy to put on! I loved that you could file them down (easily) to match your nail shape. Putting them on, they looked great on my nails. Very natural and pretty! I also liked that because you glued them on, you could easily add designs on the nail prior to gluing them. The only con is that if you've never done them before (like me), you could get air bubbles. Anyways, the nails looked so great and I immediately got compliments from my family. They're supposed to last a couple days, however, I think due to my mistake of not gluing them on correctly, but also because I was trying on wetsuits, I did manage to take one off the 2nd day I wore them. So I did end up taking them off and I have to say that it was easy to remove also. They removed painlessly (I was terrible, I pulled them off) and my nails look fine. Final thoughts: I can't believe I used to pay 40 for salon french tips (acrylics). Never again. These totally won me over to the home kits and I like that they're customizable! Love them! BUY THEM.

("This was my first time to apply artificial nails in thirty years and it will probably be another thirty years until I do it again. Long nails just aren't for me. I usually file my nails down to the quick so I can't really get used to these but if you are used to having long nails, whether real or artificial, you'll really like these. The tab makes them easy to apply and each tab is numbered with its size so you can easily find its mate for your other hand. It's a good idea to write the numbers and in what order they are applied so you won't have to do it the next time. Fit them to the sides of your nail, not just the nail bed to find your best fit. Bear in mind that the numbers are guidelines for the opposite hands but that the sizes may vary so be sure to test before applying. This is not some innocuous nail glue, this is Super Glue and bonding time in is milliseconds so there's no time for trial and error. The tab helps with placement and the nail could not be put on easily without it so be careful not to bend it too much before you apply it. I made an error and ended up having to soak my finger in an acetone-based nail polish remover for an hour (no kidding) to nail that I had gotten out of sequence. I'm not a patient woman so if you're likely to mess up, you might want to get someone to help you apply the nails. There is a no-chip guarantee and I can attest that the nails are quite durable and I doubt you could chip them with a sandblaster. So these are definitely long-lasting. The pale pink nail and white crescent of the classic French manicure is quite pretty and is high quality. There is also a pale peach and white for those who prefer that color instead.

Also, careful not to get glue on the artificial nail - it messes up the topcoat and looks horrible. Once applied, I did normal chores like washing dishes, bathing kids, cooking, cleaning. I think the life of a few of nails were shortened by the hot water I use to clean and wash dishes. I noticed them starting to loosen after that.

Of course they do not last as long as an acrylic set but they still give me that girly, cute, clean cut feeling. My reason for knocking off one star is because the glue could be a little more adhesive. Sometimes the nails will snap off and I would not even notice until later but I suppose you get what you pay for. All around, I would recommend. Tips: Apply a generous amount of the nail glue when you apply the nails, and use the tool to wipe the excess before it dries. This will eliminate some possible bubbles and will make them stay on a while longer. Wait AT LEAST 30 minutes before you decide to pull up those skinny jeans or anything like that. It might even be better to have someone help you apply them it makes it quicker and easier if you have trouble with your less dominant hand.

You start the process by removing all nail polish and oil from your nails. Then you go in with the manicure stick included and push back your cuticles.

You can trim the sides a bit with the nail file if needed. Then you hold the nails by the tab and apply the glue. You also add a little glue to your natural nail. Then you apply the nail slowly and hold until it sticks. Wipe the excess glue. Then just bend the tab and twist to remove it. After that you just apply a top coat and you are all done. :) You have adorable little nails. A couple things I will say though. First, these nails aren't intended to last longer than 10 days.

It is very hard to type and do other things especially with my kids with long nails when you are not used to them. Next day I did trim down. Like them better like this.

So the fact that I got this in my Spring Fling VoxBox was super convenient. This product is awesome because it has all the tools you would need and only takes about five minutes to apply.

I have nothing to complain about other than the nails come off, but it comes with the territory. I spend about 6 hours typing and I'm changing diapers, moving furniture, cooking, cleaning...so what can I expect The good thing though is that they come with extra nails to replace the ones that come off.

One thing I loved about this set in comparison to other brands Ive tried in the past is the fact that the white tip is fused into the nail and not airbrushed on. This is perfect if you want to buff the shine off of the nails or you may want to experiment with color and remove it later with nail polish remover. The white tip will not fade or chip and I will recommend that you clean your nails with acetone or buff them before you apply the glue so it can stick better. Cover the nail entirely with a good amount of glue because if you don't air bubbles will be visible underneath the nail and it won't look natural. The box stated that the nails lasted for 7 days and mine last about that long.

My eye care professional gives out free samples of this stuff whenever I visit. I've tried it multiple times, and each time I get the same results. Red itchy eyes, hyper-sensitivity to my contacts, and blurred vision. I tried giving all of the samples and the large bottles that I'd purchased to friends and family, but they all said they couldn't use it either, so now the bottles end up in the trash. Opti-Free Express works much better, and the Equate Multi-Purpose (about 4 per bottle) works as well as that.", {'entities': [(546, 555, 'PRODUCT')]})

I was having to take them out several times a day to rub them clean and rinse them off. I thought it was my eyes for several days and just switched to glasses. Absolutely no problem with my glasses. Next I switched to a fresh pair of contacts. The same problem occurred within hours. It was bad enough that my vision seemed to have changed. As a last ditch effort, I went to the pharmacy bought a bottle of my regular Opti-Free Replenish. Cleaned my contacts, let them soak for a bit rinsed them off. It took a few cycles of rinsing, but after that there were no more problems. I will never use the Puremoist again. An expensive lesson because I cannot find the receipt. I trusted the brand and never thought there would be such a severe problem switching from one version to a supposedly better version. I'm very disappointed with the Puremoist. On the other hand, I'm very happy with the Replenish.", {'entities': [(16, 25, 'PRODUCT')]})
