("A good face cream is difficult to find at the best of times, but when you have sensitive, acne prone skin like mine it can be downright impossible. I decided to sign up and get a free trial size of Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer with the hopes that it's promises would pay off, and that my picky skin would tolerate the cream. When reading the box, this cream claims to provide 7 benefits for younger, healthier looking skin in 4 weeks. The most intriguing for me were visibly smoothes fine lines and wrinkles, evens skin tone appearance, minimizes the look of pores, and of course replenishes moisture. Extra listed bonuses is that is is oil free which is a must for acne prone skin like mine. I have been using this moisturizer every night for 3 weeks so far and my skin is thanking me. The cream absorbs quickly into my skin for a non greasy feel and my skin has never been softer. I have noticed maybe a small amount of smoothing in the wrinkles on my forehead but honestly not a huge amount. I have however noticed a more significant change in my skin tone which has evened out quite a bit, and a small reduction in the appearance of my pores (which were quite large in appearance beforehand). The bottle dispenses the perfect amount of product every time which minimizes wasted product and amazingly my skin has not been breaking out as bad since I have been using this moisturizer. My only real complaint is that it has no SPF protection which is why I have only been using it as a night cream.

My skin tone is much for even and smooth looking. 3.Enhances brightness... I don't know that I can say my skin has brightened, but refer to 2! 4.Minimizes the look of pores... this is another area where I have noticed a difference as well. I don't notice my pores at all without really looking. 5.Visibly reduces age spots... yes, and I think this comes with the improved skin tone as well. 6.Restores firmness... I don't notice a change here. 7.Replenishes moisture... very much so. I notice this on my forehead area. Given that we are not all equal when it comes to our skin, the very idea that I noticed such a difference in my skins tone and moisture is enough for me to recommend trying out this product for yourself.

It has a few days shy of 4 weeks for me, and it's really been this last week that I've looked in the mirror and seen a difference.

('I received the Olay Total Effects 7 in One Anti-Aging Moisturizer sample (Travel-sized) from bzzagent for free to try out and review. I shared it with a relative for around 5-6 days every morning after cleaning our faces. In my personal opinion, the sample size is perfect because it fits in to my palm and it has pump mechanism which means no twisting the cap. Nice! The fragrance is very light and nice which is good. It reminds me of baby products. The moisturizer has very light consistency so it does not feel heavy on the face. Infact, I completely forgot that my face was not bare after few seconds of application. The moisturizer has also creamy/pearly/off-white colour but it is almost transparent on the face. However, I did notice that if I applied too much, my facial tissue would stained yellowish as I wipe my face which is the only reason I took out a star. This almost transparent moisturizer does cover the uneven skin tone lightly which portrays my skin smoother and brighter. I did not see any lasting effects because I ran out of the sample as we were two people trying it. But me and my relative were sure that this one product could replace most of our routine products on daily basis. I have sensitive skin which burns, turns red and gets bumpy if I use any wrong product. But this product worked out nicely for me. I did not experience any redness or burning.

("When I was chosen as one of the BzzAgents to try the new Olay Total Effects 7 In One Anti-Aging Moisturizer, I was a little bit hesitant at first because I always thought of the Olay line of products as being very oily and creamy meant for very dry and weathered skin types. Since I have naturally oily skin, I thought that it was going to make me breakout. But after trying the product, I was truly pleasantly surprised. It wasn't extremely oily at all but rather very smooth and fast-absorbing. I read the information details on the packaging and saw the 7 benefits in 1 as well as the addition of the VitaNiacin Complex which sounded all so amazing. Because I have been extremely busy due to the holiday season, I have used the product for several weeks now before even writing this review so I have really tried the product and seen the effects on my face closeup. I used the Olay moisturizer twice daily, morning and night, and loved it. It was non-greasy and fast-absorbing like it stated. It never clogged my pores and didn't make me breakout like I thought it might. Instead, it really helped with my uneven skin tone and moisturized my skin without making it feeling oily or sticky. I noticed that it seemed to minimize my pores overall and worked well under my face powder. I really liked that it was oil-free and believe that this is the reason why it didn't make me breakout. Overall, I enjoyed using this moisturizer and think this could be a great replacement for all those overpriced moisturizers out in the market today. I plan to look for this product at my favourite stores in the future. This review was collected as part of a promotion.", {'entities': [(57, 61, 'PRODUCT')]})
('After using Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer (a trial size given to me at no charge in exchange for my review) I found my skin to be well hydrated and comfortable. Winter is hard on my skin but while using this product my skin did not feel tight, skin tone was evened out, and there were no dry patches, which meant make up went on smooth and looked great! Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer claims to -Visibly smoothes fine lines and wrinkles -Evens skin tone appearance -Enhances brightness -Minimizes the look of pores -Visibly reduces age spots -Restores firmness -Replenishes moisture I found it helped with my fine lines and skin tone, and I may have looked a little brighter :) I am not sure it helped with the look of my pores but it did replenish moisture, and in turn, firmness. As far as age spots go I do not have any noticeable ones on my face so I cannot comment on that point. I look for a product the has little to no scent, does not sting or cause redness to my sensitive skin, does not make my skin feel tight, does not leave dry patches but also does not make my skin feel or look greasy. Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer covered all of that. Overall I believe this product to do what it claims to to some degree. Everyone has different skin and different degrees of issues but I think by using Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer people will find it will address at least some, if not all, of their skin issues.

("Claims that the Olay Total Effects makes 1. Visibly smoothes fine lines and wrinkles - does make the lines and wrinkles less noticeable, could be due to the fact that this moisturizer does have a bit of a beige colour to it 2.Evens skin tone appearance - does appear to even out the skin tone again, this could be due to the colour in the moisturizer 3.Enhances brightness - does enhance the brightness, again, this could be due to the colour in the moisturizer 4.Minimizes the look of pores - does make the pores less noticeable, again, this could be due tot he colour in the moisturizer 5.Visibly reduces age spots - does not reduce the age spots, the sample size is small (although much larger than some other sample I've received) and might need to use it for a longer period of time 6.Restores firmness - skin did feel a bit firmer but only lasted for a short period of time 7.Replenishes moisture - definitely moisturized and there is less dry flaky skin on my face Other things I like about the moisturizer is that there is no scent and does not tingle when it's used. Works just as well as the Clinique moisturizer in the short term basis but don't know about long term. Moisturizers seems to work well for the first couple that I use then and then after that not as well. My face may have gotten used to the combination of moisturizers and might be missing a few other key ingredients. When then happens, I usually go back to the Clinique which has not failed me yet.

I have yet to visibly see any changes with my skin since I've only been using it since I received it maybe 10 days ago.

("I have to admit, I don't always follow a regular routine for my skin and it pays the price. I've had to hold off on my review in order to indicate some results that are fair to Olay Total Effects. I have definitely noticed some smoothing in my face which is fantastic. I spend a ton of time outdoors in the winter which causes some chaffing for sure. It's been nice to see some of that reversed especially under my eyes which gets really rough for some reason (maybe from my eyes watering in the wind!). I very much luck out with a lack of age spots, but I've certainly found the Olay Total Effects evening and brightening my skin tone in general. Another really fab feature here is the lack of perfume in the product. I love that, and it sure makes it nice around the eyes because it doesn't cause stinging. Now, I've spoken to both the group of ladies that I work with as well as a couple of friends about Olay Total Effects and I've had feedback from them saying that they see a difference too. Now some of that might be flattery on their part, but true friends always tell you when you look like the dog's breakfast and I've had no indication of that either lol. I'm adding a pic, but please don't blame Olay for the look! I'll admit I'm unsure what the retail cost is on the Olay Total Effects, but I honestly think it would be worth the purchase as long as you stick with a regular use routine.

("Knowing how much I love Olay moisturizer and how gentle it's been on my skin (I've been using their original beauty fluid since the age of 15), I was very excited to try a FREE sample of Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer for review. This particular moisturizer in Olay's vast line of products purported to do the following: 1) Minimize the appearance of fine lines 2) Nourish the skin with rich moisturization 3) Enhance and even out skin tone 4) Gently exfoliate 5) Minimize and refine pores 6) Defense against free radicals 7) Subtle lifting of the skin for a more youthful appearance Upon initial use, I found the product to have a nice light scent and a smooth velvety texture. The consistency was a little thicker than the moisturizer I normally use so I was hesitant at first to use it as my skin is easily irritated. However, I found it absorbed very well. Like any woman, I scrutinize my face on a regular basis. I noticed right away that my face felt immediately softer. While the fine lines remained after 3 weeks of use, I did notice that my skin seemed brighter within a week. I imagine if I was able to test a full-sized sample for a longer period of time, I would have noticed a bigger different. Though not as strong as some of the more expensive products out there, this one has great value and gives you what you three or more products would give you, all in one package.

I used it this morning and checked back after 30 minutes but did not notice much of a difference right away. The product claims to make a noticeable difference in 4 weeks, though, so I will use the product for 28 consecutive days (or until I run out of sample product!) and report back with my results. For this review I'll just focus on my first thoughts: 1) I appreciate that my sample is fragrance-free. I am sensitive to fragrances and this one just left me smelling clean. 2) I LOVE the way the cream feels. It is like a cloud on your skin, seriously. Most moisturizers leave me feeling greasy and heavy but this one is so smooth and left my skin hydrated but dry. 3) This product comes with a pump which I like much better than the regular squeeze tops. But you probably don't need the whole pump! I used a whole one today and it was too much for my face and neck. Next time I'll use half a pump and add more if I need it. 4) My current moisturizer provides my skin with vitamins and nutrients so I was really happy to hear that Total Effects does the same, and that is what really helps fight the signs of aging.

Because of this, I began using this Olay moisturizer with my skin already soft and in good condition (not dry/patchy/oily). When first using the moisturizer, I found it to be very easy to spread (it isn't thick), and it dried quickly. However, I did notice that it left a bit of a sheen to my skin (kind of a slightly damp-skin look). It wasn't unpleasant, nor overly oily, but I do suspect this was what gave my skin a brighter look/youthful glow. Although this did work wonderfully as a moisturizer, I did not notice any difference to the laugh lines/fine lines on my face, but perhaps 3.5 weeks of use is too early to draw a conclusion about this. I don't yet have age spots, so I cannot speak to whether or not it is effective at minimizing their appearance. I have only ever used 1 other kind of anti-aging moisturizer (Meaningful Beauty), which I found left my skin scaley and oily. It was a miserable experience and took weeks to repair the damage it caused. This Olay moisturizer fares so much better.

I can't really say I've noticed any visible difference in any fine lines but that being said, I don't really have many. My skin does appear to have a more even tone though which I really like. I think the best feature is the moisturizing. It's been a pretty dry winter and my skin feels quite moisturized.

('Olay Total Effects is a great moisturizer that improves skin texture, moisturizes without feeling greasy, evens skin tone, firms, and minimizes pores! Fortunately I am not yet faced with age spots and wrinkles but I will definitely continue to use the product to help slow the aging hands of time! My skin definitely looks brighter and smoother!! Next time I will try the fragrance free moisturizer as my skin has been more sensitive during the dry winter months!

("As of late, I've been suffering from uneven skin tone, large pores, and the beginning states of fine lines. Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer has brightened and firmed my skin, and reduced the look of fine lines around my mouth and eyes.

Of the various moisturizers I've tried in the past, this 1 has the best bottle because of the perfect pump. 1 squeeze of the pump always dispenses the perfect amount of product so there's no mess, fuss, or waste. And the ease of use continues onto the application results, as it's so silky smooth to put on, leaves my skin smooth too!

I do however feel like my skin is more moisturized, softer, nonoily, skin tone is brighter. I did not feel any burning, or any smell, I did feel some tightness about a half hour after applying the cream each time. This must mean it's working, we will have to wait and see.

I don't have any bumpy skin like I usually have on my forehead upper cheeks, and my skin is more even coloured. I put it on while I sleep, and clean it off when I get up and go about my day, so any dirt or sweat won't interact with the cream and make me break out.

("I think the Olay Total Effects 7 in one Anti-Aging Moisterizer does a wonderful job of giving moisture and life in a non-greasy way to my skin. I can only comment for myself, as I really don't have wrinkles or any of the other signs of aging that this product is supposed to help. It does provide a youthful, fresh feel to my face, and I've only used it for the last five days, so I can't comment on the long term effects, but would I continue to use it Perhaps, but it is too soon to comment further. I do appreciate BzzAgent for providing this free sample size to comment on. Olay is a product line I have used for years, and I trust their products, and yes, I would encourage my friends to give it a try themselves...:) If I was my friends, I would want to know the 7 effects of aging and how Olay Total Effects in one could combat those aging issues. I would also want to know if it was safe and would it have cause and effects to prevent and protect by its usage the expediancy of those issues if I was to use it prematurely. Like I said, I love the product, it's mild fragrance, it's moisturizing appeal, with a non-greasy feel, it's unique vitamin complex which helps to fight the seven signs of aging, such as fine lines, age spots and uneven skin tones, to name a few, and how it lasts all day without having to reapply.

I didn't feel like I had too much on my face. I REALLY liked the pump dispenser. It seemed do much more hygienic than dipping your finger in a tub of cream. I think my skin looked well hydrated. The reason I didn't give it a 5 out of 5 was because it didn't really fade dark spots. I had a few on my cheekbones and they did not fade much if at all.

("Using Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer for the first time was exciting! Who doesn't want to look younger I was particular interested in the wrinkle and fine line smoothing, and the reducing the look of pores. I've officially used it every day since receiving it, annnnnd... sad to say, I can't see much of a difference. In terms of anti-aging, I'm not sure it did much for me that my regular moisturizer doesn't already do, I suppose. Nothing on my face really changed. My forehead wrinkles remained small crevasses, my pores are still as visible as ever, and my skin tone is unchanged. I've attached a picture of my forehead lines before and after I'd used Olay Total Effects for awhile. As you can see, not much of a change. However! I give it an A+ for being a moisturizer! It's smooth, it's soft, it's light. It spreads across the skin nicely, it moisturizes like a boss, and it has a really nice scent. It doesn't leave your skin feeling greasy at all. Usually I'm not a fan of putting on moisturizer on before I go to bed, since it leaves my skin feeling kind of gross (and often leads to a breakout), but when I felt how light it was, I wanted to give it a try. Four weeks of moisturizing before bed, no greasiness, no acne. I have a strangely mixed review for this product, unfortunately. While it fell short (for me) in the anti-aging department, I'd still say it's a great moisturizer! This review was collected as part of a promotion.", {'entities': [(6, 10, 'PRODUCT')]})
('It has been awhile since I have used Olay and now I am converted back! I love this new Olay anti-aging moisturizer. It comes in a pump so the rest of the cream does not get contaminated.

I could see myself purchasing a full size of the Olay anti-aging moisturizer. I have no idea if it does anything to my fine lines, age spots and uneven skin tones.

('I have now been using this cream for over a month and wanted to update on the changes that I have seen in my skin. I noticed some differences right away using this cream with the tone and texture of my face. Mostly this had to do with my skin being much more moisturized and feeling a lot softer. This cream continues to deliver in these areas, and even with the winter cold my skin has stayed moisturized and I have not had as many of the rough, dry patches that I usually get when the cold weather hits. However, now that I have been suing the Olay Total Effects for longer I have seen small changes in the fine lines and appearance of my skin as well. I am fortunate to have good genes but I do have a number of areas where age is creeping in and I am staring to get small lines or a change in the tone of my skin. The Olay Total Effects has helped with decreasing the appearance of the lines and making them less notices. I have also noticed that over time my skin is much more supple and there is an improvement in the tone and evenness of my skin. I do struggle with having uneven skin tone and the Olay has helped with keeping my face much more balanced and ensuring that there are not as dramatic changes in the colour and texture of my face overall.

("I received the Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer to try out as a BzzAgent, and wanted to use it for a few weeks before giving an opinion, since it usually takes at least that long for my skin to adjust to a new product or regime. My first thoughts on this product were very positive: 1-texture and formula: One of my favorite things about the product is how light and silky it is. It feels very smooth and light, even though it packs a punch in terms of performance. I find sometimes products that claim the same as this are very heavy, thick and sticky, and this is not like that at all. It also spreads very nicely and is easily absorbed. 2-scent: This product has a very mild sweet scent, which I really like, because products that smell too strongly or perfumed are not pleasant to use. This has a mild scent which fades within minutes of application. Now, as for actual performance, I give this product a solid 4 out of 5 stars. I didn't notice much of a difference in my fine lines overall, however, I do see a big difference in my complexion. My skintone is more even and looks healthier. I'm not sure this product is heavy enough for how dry my skin gets in the dead of winter, but it's a wonderful cream so far that has kept my face adequately moisturized. I think it's a fantastic solution for anyone with normal to mildly dry skin for overall improvement. This review was collected as part of a promotion.", {'entities': [(15, 19, 'PRODUCT')]})
("I have been using Olay products for years. Until receiving this trial for Total Effects, I thought my skin was getting all the moisture it needed. I find this moisturizer so creamy and penetrating. For minutes after application, I can feel the soft moisture soaking into my skin. I do have 'thick' skin and I get oily in my t-zone throughout the day. This still happens, but I am not having mini break outs like I did before. I notice my skin is brighter, definitely more clear and I believe my pores appear smaller too.

Also there does seem to be a reduction in pore size. Concerning age spots I can't comment,luckily I don't have any. Yet. Although if I continue using Olay total effects maybe it won't ever become a problem. From what I've seen at my local pharmacy Olay appears to be fairly priced,I feel like a small amount goes along way in application so a full sized bottle should last fairly long.

("I am a skeptical person by nature. I generally don't believe things I read or hear, unless I see some kind of proof, especially when it comes to marketing of products. So, when I received a freebie of the new trial size of Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer, I was not going to leave a review until I had actually tried it for the recommended time and could offer concrete opinions to other women. I am a busy working mom of two, and honestly, moisturizing daily sometimes gets forgotten. I really noticed how my skin drank in the Olay 7 in 1. I took a close-up selfie before I started, and then again 3 weeks later, and I definitely can see a few improvements. For example, the lines near my eyes are fainter, I cannot deny. Overall, my skin is brighter and feels firmer. My skin tone is more even, and I've noticed that my makeup goes on more smoothly and evenly, which is a definite plus. I can't say that my red spots have faded all that much perhaps more time is needed for that. For a cream, though, I'm impressed with the effects it has had. I am not into invasive procedures like surgery or Botox, so for me, a moisturizer that does what it claims to do is important. I do wish the trial size had a little bit more product in it, though. Olay says we can see the full effects after 4 weeks, but I found that I was only able to get 3 weeks out of the trial size, using it once daily. For that reason, I'm giving it 4 out of 5 stars.

("Well I've used Olay total effects for a while now, and have noticed pretty good results! I first want to start by saying I love the the pump style bottle it comes in. I'm an esthetician and know how you can contaminate your products by putting your fingers into a container! Well I am a pretty tuff critic because I have used a lot of exspensive spa line products because I'm in the esthetic indusrty. I have to say that the smell of total effects is very light and pleasant and not at all potent. The texture of the cream is silky smooth and is not to watery or to heavy on the skin. It absorbs nicely and gives your skin a smooth hydrated feeling! I notice a slight tint to the lotion which is probably what gives my skin a nice glow! Love all the high quality performance ingredients in total effects. My skin tone looks much more even and hydrated since using it, I have a healthy looking glow and my fine lines seem a bit smoother.

I recently started wearing foundation as part of my make up routineI was never a makeup person until a couple months ago, and noticed that my smile lines left a wrinkle when I am not smiling (which is obviously not desired by me). This was my target area for this cream, and I have to say the cream did its job. IT IS AMAZING. Those smile wrinkles are almost non-existent now. I can feel a world of a difference in my face. Overall my skin is smoother, richer, firmer, brighter and glowing! I cannot believe what a difference using the right cream will do to your face! However, there is one thing I would work on with the formula, and that is to make it absorb into the face more easily, because if you do not work it in yourself, you are left with little white clumps of cream that did not absorb. But, that can be solved by working in the cream yourself. By the way, I forgot to mention, in addition to improving my smile wrinkles, the pores on my cheeks and nose were also minimized, which ultimately made this a fantastic product to use because I truly feel years younger :) If you have a smile wrinkle problem and large pore problem, I would really suggest you trying this out and putting it on at bedtime every night, and see if it works for you.

('I have been looking for a moisturizer that goes on light, has SPF, lasts all day and improves the look and feel of my skin. I was pleasantly surprised after using Olay Total Effects that all those boxes were checked. After a few days I noticed an improvement in the look and feel of my skin. The formula goes on lightly and a little goes a long way. It lasts all day as I wear it under foundation. While it is winter, I spend lots of time outside and I like that it offers sun protection.

("I received a sample of Olay 7 in 1 moisturizer from BzzAgent over a month ago. I have been using the product and have recently purchased a new bottle, since i loved it so much :) The cream goes on smooth is not greasy and absorbs into the skin quite quickly! The fine lines in the corner of my eyes have diminished and my skin appears brighter more awake and firmer. I have had quite a few compliments from friends family and co-workers about my appearance and the fact my eyes look brighter and my skin looks more refreshed. As I am entering my fourties, i am certainly beaming with pride that I have finally found a cream that certainly lives up to its promise of younger and firmer looking skin! I highly recommend this product to friends and family and any women out there looking for a moisturizer that is easy to use and creates many wonderful benefits! The product is also formulated with numerous vitamins which are certainly an added bonus to Olay's new found freedom to as they say fighting the signs of aging. Unfortunately, aging bodies and skin is one thing we can never control, but thank to Olay's 7 in 1 moisturizing cream - we can slow down the process and look many years younger than our actual real birth age! Try it for yourself you and your face will be glad you did :) Thanks Olay for this amazing cream and to BzzAgent for the opportunity to test and review the product!

("My main concern with any moisturizer is whether it causes acne as I have dry-oily combination skin and choosing the right moisturizer can be tricky. After a few weeks of using the Olay Total Effects I'm mostly quite impressed. My skin handled it better than it does Cetaphil, and that's supposedly the best for acne-prone skin. I did get a few very tiny white heads a week in, but that may also have been the after effects of sleeping with foundation, so I'm not going to hold it against this product. I also found it very light and quick absorbing so it didn't feel like I had moisturizer on my face for a half-hour like some moisturizers do, but still did the job of nourishing. I felt like my skin looked healthy with even a more notably peachy blush on my cheeks a few weeks into application, but I'm not sure if that was what is meant by the brightening effect Olay 7 in 1 claims to have. I wouldnt say my skin looked brighter, just healthier. I don't have wrinkles so I can't say I noticed any skin smoothing effect either. My only criticism is that the cream is scented. While it smells pleasant, I prefer putting the least amount of chemicals on my face and it makes me worry about the ingredients more than I may have otherwise.

I have now been using this cream daily for several weeks and I have noticed my skin tone getting more even and my skin is radiant after I apply it. I really like the bottle with the pump because it lets out the perfect amount for each application. The formula has a faint scent but not bother me in the slightest. I also find that the formula is not at all greasy so my skin drinks it in quickly and I can apply my make up shortly after. The only downside I would have to say it that I wish it was a little bit thicker or I would need to use in addition another eye cream because my skin gets very dry, especially in the winter time and I enjoy using a richer denser cream around my under eye at nighttime.

The first non-mineral sunscreen I've used that hasn't irritated my skin! Yippee. I'm also very pleased with the formula and how my skin has been looking. It keeps my skin moisturizer without feeling heavy and keeps my skin moisturizer all day. It does take a few minutes to sink in, but by the time I dry my hair in the morning my face is ready for makeup application. No pilling or balling. Usually by mid-day when wearing other SPF lotions I start to see fine lines on my cheeks (from dryness) and sometimes rough patches and enlarged pores, but not with this! The SPF 15 is obviously not high enough for a day in the sun, but it's my new go-to winter/ office daily moisturizer. It's a bit pricey for a drugstore product however, the fact that it's SPF, fragrance-free, actually moisturizing, and has niacinimide and other good skin ingredients make this a buy again product for me One thing I didn't like is packaging because you can't see how much product is remaining. Although I do likeannoying, the pump-style packaging, as it's hygienic and the ingredients aren't exposed to light or air.

('I have been using the Olay moisturizer for about 2 weeks now, and I am so far pleased with it. It goes on very easily, nice and smooth. What I worried about the most is that it would leave a greasy feel or look to my face and this product definitely does neither of those. When the colder weather comes my face tends to get very dry and I have a hard time finding something to help with this, so far as this Olay product puts moisture back in my face and have noticed my dryness is gone. I have also noticed my lines reducing and my skin tone much more even. I will continue to use this product and hope it continues to work as well as it is so far!

("I have been using the Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 product for about 2 weeks now. I'm anticipating I will see more of a difference after the 4 weeks as stated by the product, and I'm very hopeful! As far as the 'unique vitamin complex' that is fighting the seven signs of aging goes, my main concerns are fine lines and reducing appearance of pores! I haven't noticed much of a difference in this respect - yet! I've only just started with the product. However my skin is very sensitive and picky and so far this moisturizer has been wonderful. The only thing I will say - and this is just a personal preference - is that it seems very perfume-y! Now keep in mind, with my sensitive skin I usually go the unscented route, so it's probably not even that perfume-y, I'm likely just not used to it. I also wear a mask at work, so for the first half of the day I'm directly inhaling it - haha! By the afternoon there isn't much scent left which is nice for me. As far as just compared to any moisturizer I love how light it feels putting it on and throughout the day, not thick or sticky or anything, instantly dry - for this reason alone (regardless of how much it ends up helping with the anti aging) I'm already planning on buying the full size of this product to add to my regular routine!

I see that it comes in a form that includes sunscreen so I'm even more of a fan now! Prior to using this I always used plain vitamin E cream. It worked well but I see fine lines creeping up when I look very closely in the mirror. My face feels great when I wear the Olay and I love how light it feels and it absorbs so quickly compared to my old cream. I'm fairly red skinned and find that my redness isn't as pronounced now. I'm not one to spend a fortune on skin creams because my skin is relatively good so the price is just at my high end of what I would buy.

I know for sure that my skin looks brighter and is well moisturized. I even had a comment from a friend who I haven't seen in weeks. She said that my skin looks great and it looks like I had a good night's sleep. However, I haven't seen a reduction in the fine lines and wrinkles around or between my eyes and mouth or a reduction in the size of my pores. I will continue to use it until it is all gone and may even buy another bottle when it becomes available in 2016, just to see if I can see more improvements to my skin. I have a few freckles or age spots on my cheeks and I haven't seen them lighten either. Overall though, I do like the moisturizing effect of Olay and the fact that it absorbs into my skin quickly in the morning before I put on my foundation and in the evening before going to sleep. I would still recommend Olay to others saying that it is a good all-round moisturizer and if I see a difference in the next few weeks or after using a second bottle, I will extol the virtues of Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer to anyone who will listen!

('Olay continues to be a classic for good reason. Their products always stand up to the reputation of a brand that you can rely on. Here are some of the reasons why I enjoyed using the Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer. The pump dispenses just the right amount of product. The light scent of the moisturizer is refreshing and not over-powering. My skin feels hydrated and fresh all day long. My skin looks brighter and feels smoother. I have very dry skin on my nose and this time of year is worst for me with the cold dry weather. My skin felt great, not tight at all.

I did not notice that it reduced any of my fine lines or reduced the look of age spots but it did make my skin appear brighter and minimized the look of pores.

I do find it nicely moisturizing, especially in this winter weather which can often dry my skin out like crazy, but I haven't found that happening this year! It does have a strong perfume-y scent, so I will be purchasing the Fragrance-Free version as I can't take the smell. As regards the other benefits touted by Olay, I'm really not sure I see them happening. Overall a good moisturizer for a good price.

As for the promises it makes, after only the first week I can see how smoothing it could be to someone who has a lot of fine lines. I still haven't seen an improvement on dark spots or a more even skin tone, but I assume that will take a little more than a week to take effect.

I haven't noticed a difference in my fine lines yet but I think it is too early to tell. I can definitely say that my skin tone is much more even and my skin looks hydrated, which is hard to combat with the heating in the house. The only slight issue I have with this cream is the smell. I applied it liberally around my nose area where I had a lot of dryness and the smell was very overpowering. If you keep it away from your nose it's not as bad but I still would prefer a fragrance free option. I think that Olay products consistently have high reviews because they actually do work. I like that this Moistirizer has a vitamin complex and it makes me feel good about using it. I find that it works best when you apply it directly after your shower or washing your face so that it can absorb deeper into your skin. I received this product in exchange for an honest review.

I'm not quite at the stage of fighting wrinkles and age spots, but as far as moisturizing, firming and brightening, Olay did as promised. The cream itself is light weight. It doesn't feel heavy or sticky on my skin, nor does it give an unwanted shine. I also found the 'a little dab'll do ya' rule applied as well. I would consider my skin normal to dry, leaning more to the dry side, especially around my nose. I noticed a difference for the better within about 10-14 days. I'm also someone who has post acne scars. Not a lot of them, just mostly from recent pimples that are taking their time to clear up.

I have used Olay Total Effects for about three weeks now and I admit I see the total effect! Winter and cold weather have been thrust upon us. I am in a snowy and cold part of the Country which really effects my skin. In the winter my lines are amplified and my skin feels very dry. Since I have been using Olay Total Effects this winter has been different! No longer does my skin feel taught and dry. My face feels moisturized and well nourished. I find that Olay lasts throughout the day so I do not have to keep reapplying and reapplying. I also have found that a little goes a long way. This means that you don't have to put globs and globs of product all over! The only con I can say is that I did not really like about the product is its dispenser.

('I started using Olay TotalEffects 7 in 1 anti-aging moisturizer for several days now, havent seen anything major on my skin, however will say a little drop goes a VERY long way, I have quite dry skin so need to use a significant amount to feel like my skin is moisturized, only having to use a little bit is a bonus to my skin and wallet. I like how it has a little bit of a tint as well. I quite like the very light scent of the cream. Might have been able to report with bigger results to my actual skin but considering the size of the sample wont last too long. I like that being a 7 in 1, takes care of the need to use multiple products. For busy women on the go like me, this product is definitely great for my morning routine.

I love it's smooth, fast absorbing cream and the smell is light and agreeable too. My skin looks smoother and brighter, but not greasy-looking. I think my skin now has an even tone, and some of the fine lines have minimized, but I'm sad to say that the wrinkles under my eyes are still there. I don't have age spots so I can't report on whether or not it works on that particular sign of aging. The non-greasy moisturizer has not caused me to breakout, which I tend to do with most moisturizers. For the most part, I am now an Olay Total Effects believer!

I find a lot of the greasy or they cause me to break out. Not only has the Olay Total Effects moisturizer made my face more soft, but it in non greasy and my complexion seems to actually be clearing up:) That is a huge relief! I have been using the Olay brand for quite some time as I have combination skin. Although their products seemed to take care of the dryness in some spots, it seemed to make other spots more oily.

('I have been using Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer for a few weeks now before bed. I have always enjoyed using Olay products since they are very gentle on my skin and this product is no different. I am thirty and starting to consider using anti-aging products preemptively to slow down aging, this is the first product I have used that is specifically designed for anti-aging and I have been pleased with the product. While I have not seen any noticeable difference in my fine lines, I was pleased with other aspects of the moisturizer. I began using it at the beginning of winter. My skin often gets quite dry, but Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer did a very good job of keeping my skin moisturized. It moisturized well, yet still felt lightweight on my skin and absorbed well. I only apply moisturizer with SPF as my day moisturizer. Since the trial size of Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer I received did not contain SPF I chose to apply the moisturizer at night only. Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer does come with SPF 15 as well, and I would like to purchase that to use during the day and see if using the Total Effects moisturizers both morning and night would make a difference on my fine lines.

I guess my face was needing some intense hydration! I started out trying it at night, wasn't too sure if it was too rich for daytime. But after a couple of weeks I liked what I saw in the morning. My skin didn't look as dry and not as tired. With the moisture my wrinkles looked like they were smoothing out. My co workers were giving me good feedback on how my skin was looking.

It went on very smooth and the light scent was very calming and refreshing. It amazingly kept my skin moisturized all day long while at the same time it smoothed out my uneven skin tone, reduced the appearance of my age spots, and overall, just brightened my face with a bit of a glow.

My husband even said my skin felt really soft the other day to me. And when the husbands notice, that's big! I have noticed my skin tone is a bit brighter as well which is one problem I have that bothers me. I think it would be a product that I would buy once it comes out in February.

Before trying this I was looking for a product that wont make my face all oily or take lots of time to apply and remove. So you can imagine how excited I was.

Just to give you an idea of my skin type - I'm 26 and my skin is just starting to become dryer, it has always been very oily, so I was hesitant about using a moisturizer (almost EVERY moisturizer makes me break out) and adding more moisture to my skin. I get breakouts in my t zone often and I regularly use spot treatments and acne products. I've been using this moisturizer every morning before putting on makeup and it has made my skin feel softer and more supple. I feel like it has more of a 'glow' that it used to and my skin appears more firm and moisturized. In regards to the other effects of this cream, I don't feel like I've noticed a difference in my pore size, fine lines, or skin tone. I still have about half the bottle left so I'll have to wait and see if this cream improves with continued use.

The formula doesn't have a strong scent and goes on smoothly leaving my skin so soft.

('I got to try this product in a generous sample size which lsted me for several weeks. I was very pleasantly surprised by the product, and will absolutely purchase it in the future. I am in my early-mid thirties, and this is just the type of product I have been looking for. Often I find anti-aging creams can be much to rich for my normal/combination skin, but this is light and absorbs quickly, while still providing just the right amount of moisture. Aside from being a lovely moisturizer, the most noticable results of this product on my skin were increased brightness and evenness of skin tone. It made my skin look and feel fabulous, and I know this because several friends commented that my skin looked glowy, and asked what I was doing differently. I was initially a little disappointed that there was no SPF in this product, but apparently there is one that has an SPF (15 I think), and I am also interested in trying that product for day and sticking with this one as a night.

It keeps my skin so well moisturized that by the end of the day I do not have the tight dry skin I normally end my work day with. Fine lines are not visible through the moisture.

I was wrong and really like this product. I have modified how I use it however, because I have noticed in the areas where my face tends to be oilier it has caused break outs (my nose and chin). For the areas where my face is drier (forehead and cheeks), this has given some great moisture to these areas and helped prevent such a dry chapped look.

Also, it is hygienic because you don't need to constantly dip your finger in a jar to take out the product. The texture is light and smooth. My skin feels well moisturized and the creme absorbs into the skin nicely and does not leave a residue.

So what I really like about this cream: THe container is so convenient for many reasons. One push and you get the right amount of cream to apply to your face + it avoids contamination since you don't dip your fingers in a jar. THat is a big bonus. THe texture is really light smooth. It would not be good as a night cream, but wonderful as a day cream (not sure about cold months though as its very thin and dries out really quick. But I love it). The scent is so mild and fresh. I feel my skin being smooth and already notice reduced fine lines which is great! What I don't like as much about this cream: well after using it for a week now my face is breaking out... So I am not sure this specific cream is the right match for me, but it could be for you. Seems to clog my pores. Same happened before when I used other Olay products for my face. Don't let this keep you from buying it as we all have different type of skin.

When I purchase this product I will look for the non-scented version but have to say that after using it for a few weeks I don't notice the scent in the scented version. The longer I use it, the more I like it and I would recommend it to others. This review was collected as part of a promotion.", {'entities': [(23, 27, 'PRODUCT')]})
('The Olay total effects 7 in one anti-aging moisturizer is very good to gives my skin the perfect amount of moisture. It leaves my skin looking and feeling hydrated and healthy. This moisturizer is not to greasy and will not leave your skin feeling sticky. I have been using this moisturizer daily for several weeks now and I find that it does not clear away any of my darks spots and it did not smooth out my fine lines. This moisturizer did improve my skin tone and helped my skin tone look more even and brighter. I like how this moisturizer has a beautiful light scent to it. I also like the pump of the bottle because one pump lets out a perfect amount of moisturizer to use all over my face. Overall, this moisturizer does not do very much for the signs of my aging skin like fine line and dark spots but it does an awesome job at hydrating and gives my skin a nice dewy glow.

("I have been looking forward to trying this Oil of Olay 7 in 1 Anti-aging Moisturizer to see if it really works. I am 36 years old and don't have a lot of wrinkles and lines, however, I have seen results already after only using the product for two weeks. When I opened the little sample bottle and pumped some product on my fingertips I was worried that it would be too oily for my skin and cause breakouts - this was not the case at all. It is a little heavier than my regular daytime oil-free lotion and a little lighter than my night time cream. The product has a light sense which I really enjoy and applies with little to no effort. My skin has been glowing , my dry patches have disappeared and overall my skin looks healthier and feels really soft. Also, I have had no breakouts from using the product which is such a relief! ( I have sensitive skin and usually can't handle any scented moisturizers or ones that are not oil-free). I really enjoy using this product so far and can't wait to see what the results will be after another two weeks. Thanks for the sample Oil of Olay!

I was nervous to put on my face as I have pretty sensitive skin and have been allergic to different products on the past. I tried this on my hand first and felt great so I tried on my face. Here are 7 things this product claims to do... Visibly smoothes fine lines and wrinkles* I don't have a problem with this yet, so I personally didn't notice anything different. Evens skin tone appearance *It did smooth my skin, not sure I would say it evened my skin tone. Enhances brightness *my skin did look really good after. Minimizes the look of pores* I personally have pretty small pores to begin with, so I didn't notice this much. Visibly reduces age spots* I'm not at the point where I have age spots. At almost 30 people still ask if I'm 20 yet. Restores firmness* I did notice my skin was more firm. Almost as if I did a face mask. Replenishes moisture* this has help with the dry skin during the winter. Over all this is a nice product, I loved how it felt on my skin.

There were things I liked about it right away, it had a great light scent, it was thick not watery but it didn't feel heavy or greasy on face once applied but wasn't sure if there was anything special about it. Now that it has been 3-4 weeks, my face feels great, no dry patches, any redness has diminished, my face is starting to feel firmer and look brighter. I didn't have any real fine lines or wrinkles so can't speak to what effect it has on those.

The moisturizer goes on smooth with no greasy feel and absorbs quickly into the skin. I feel over the past few weeks that the area around my eyes has appeared more refreshed and the crows feet are less noticeable - it is definitely as a result of Olay's 7 in 1 cream. I did not rate this moisturizer a 5 out 5 for the simple fact of the strong scent. Although I do enjoy the perfumey refreshing scent of this product, I find it to be a tad strong and to linger on the skin long after application. It would be the perfect product, I believe, if it was unscented!

('I have been using the Olay 7 in 1 moisturizer for over a month now. My experience with this product is mostly positive. I like to put on the moisturizer in the morning, before I do my makeup. The product doesnt have a strong scent, and I like that a lot. It feels very nice on my skin, not heavy or oily. It dries quickly, so when I apply my makeup, I have no problem at all, and the two act very nicely together. As the day goes on, my skin continues to feel nicely moisturized and does not dry up. It works very well, even in the winter when it is very cold outside. I definitely like this product a lot and it makes my face feel great, but Im not sure how well the anti-aging action works. My minor wrinkles still appear to be the same as always, not very prominent, but still there. Despite this one detail, I would definitely buy this product again.

("For the longest time, Oil of Olay has been a beauty staple in my daily regime. In the mornings I use the Complete All Day Moisture Lotion with sunscreen and in the evenings I use the Classic Moisturizing Lotion. It never occurred to me to change up my regime primarily since I'm a believer of the saying if it ain't broke, don't fix it. However (and sadly) I'm not getting any younger, so it was time to review and update my beauty regimen. I was excited to get the opportunity to review Olay Total Effects 7-in-1 Anti-Aging Daily Moisturizer. It claims to hydrate and diminish the appearance of fine lines, large pores and dark spots. The key ingredients include niacinamide to improve tone and texture glycerin to moisturize and vitamins B3, B5 and E as antioxidants. Upon first use the lotion has a light scent and quickly sinks in making my skin feel super moisturized right away. I've been using it for almost one week now and while I don't have fine lines and wrinkles, I did notice a nice glow. I will continue to use and hope to see additional benefits.

I have been putting it on morning and night after I wash my face and the very first thing I've noticed is that my face is a lot softer then it has ever been. The lines around my eyes, even though are still there, have definitely become softer. That, for me, is a wonderful thing :) I haven't seen a big difference in the size of my pores but as I continue to use this product, I will continue to take pictures periodically. The cream rubs in very well and doesn't leave any greasy or oily finish on the skin. It's great for putting on right before you apply makeup as well.

It has the same great fragrance and the rest of the Olay product line, which I appreciate very much. No other brands have, for me, come close to Olay in terms of smell. It's subtle, yet pleasant enough to make a statement. The moisturizer feel light and refreshing on the face and also distributes very evenly with no residue. I have breakout prone combination skin so I am always very careful when choosing skincare products. I was turned away from many other creams because of how heavy and oily they feel but luckily this has never been a problem with Olay. With that being said, I'm not too crazy about the pump dispenser. It makes the amount more difficult to control. The size of the bottle is also not something I would consider in stores because I don't think 15mL will be enough to create a visible difference. I always finish a full size product of anything new I try in order to avoid premature evaluations. But, I guess we shall see with this one!

Also, for those of you who worry about sensitivity, I am pretty sensitive to new products, and didn't have any problems. I did notice some of my sun spots have disappeared. There's a big one on my temple that's still there, but nothing has removed that one. The rest, looking like a mask of pregnancy or freckles, are all GONE!!

It does not seem to have any harsh ingredients in it also as it did not burn my skin. The cream applies evenly and quickly and a little goes a long way. Once the cream dries, I can immediately feel a difference in my skin, more firm somehow. Not sure about my skin looking younger though. I would have to keep using this cream on a daily basis for a month to really see if it lives up to its claims of making skin appear 10 years younger ...for now, Olay's Total Effects moisturizer is a great way for me to re-hydrate my skin after a shower.

However, it is such a good moisturizer! I live in a climate that can get down to -45 C and my skin can get very dry.

I don't even notice the smell any more. I will likely buy the scent free version however. I am finding my skin softer and less dry come the end of the day then it was with my other lotion. Before I had to reapply more than once a day, now it's good all day. As for the fine lines, after 2 weeks of using it daily I am finding they are less noticeable then before.

You do not need much of the cream to cover the entire face. I was very shocked the first time I used it. Just in the first few minutes I could feel a tightening of my skin. I've only been using the cream for two weeks, and not the four for maximum results, but I am still quite pleased with the results.

I started off using it both in the morning and evening, but didn't find it quite moisturizing enough for my extremely dry winter skin. I found I needed a little more moisture in the morning before applying my makeup. It was great for evening use, and would be great for me to use in the a.m and p.m during summer months. I have very uneven skin tone and found it didn't do too much to improve that.

It's become my go to for a quick pick me up and with the added benefits of long term results you really can't go wrong. My face goes from blah and uneven to glowing and even within seconds of application. I've definitely noticed some of the finer lines disappearing and my skin is noticeably softer as well.

("If you are looking for a moisturizer that hydrates and brightens the appearance of your skin then you should consider trying out the Olay Total Effects anti-aging moisturizer. From my own personal experience after using this moisturizer daily for several weeks now I find that it helped to even out my skin tone and it makes my skin feel soft and hydrated. I have oily combo skin and sometimes I do worry that a moisturizer might be to greasy and make my skin more oily. This moisturizer doesn't make me anymore oily at all. I feel like it provides the perfect amount of moisture for my oily combo skin, it's not to greasy at all. I like the light fresh scent of this moisturizer as well.

While I haven't really noticed any decrease in skin wrinkles (I don't think I have that many yet), it's been awesome for the health of my skin in general. Living in Canada, winter can be a problem for most skin. The air gets cold and dry and in turn dries out the skin. I've never been able to use moisturizers on my face, or if I do, I can't use them every day because my pores tend to clog easily and cause acne break-outs. The Olay Total Effects, has been easily absorbed by my skin, and I haven't had any acne problems with it at all. The skin on my face feels soft, not dry and tight like it does every fall and winter time.

It goes on nicely with no greasy or oily feeling like some I have tried. Not sure I look 10 years younger, but my skin does look better and the crows feet and other wrinkles have lessened a lot. I will be buying Olay Total Effects Anti-Aging Moisturizer as my regular moisturizer from now on in the spf version as I do really like to keep my face protected from the sun.

I think the consistency is very nice and smooth, not too thick and not too thin. I also like the fact that it helps my foundation glide on better. I have used many, many expensive face creams and products and think that Olay, which is quite reasonably priced, stacks up against the best of them! I am 55 and have some fine lines and wrinkles around my eyes and also around my mouth. I have some freckles or age spots also. My skin tone however, is quite even. Olay 7 in 1 definitely moisturizes my skin but I can't say I have seen any drastic improvement or lessening of the wrinkles or the age spots yet. Perhaps I need to use Olay Total Effects for a bit longer. I like the fact that it is fragrance free also.

First of all, I haven't had any side effects: usually with moisturizers and lotions of this type I experience skin rashes and itchiness. I've had none of that and have been using it daily for 3 weeks now. I have extremely sensitive skin and normally shy away from using new products on my face. I tried this free trial size (mainly because it is from a brand I do trust and use.) I use Original Olay cream and have stuck with it because it doesn't cause me problems. Compared with my regular face cream, I have noticed a visible brightness in my skin as well as an evenness. I find I constantly need to apply face cream because my skin is very dry however I do feel Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Moisturizer replenishes my skin a little better than my other face cream (Olay Original) I've also noticed my skin looks smoother and feels smoother.

("I think this product works great on the skin, aside from the fragrance. Instead of reaching for my expensive beauty moisturizers, I like using the Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer. It simply feels wonderful on my face. It is lightweight and it glides on smoothly on my skin. I don't need a lot of it. I just pump out smaller than a pearl-sized dot of moisturizer and it provides enough coverage for my face, my neck and decolletage. I apply this moisturizer every night before bedtime and I wake up in the mornings and my complexion looks very even. It doesn't dry out my face and no signs of allergic reaction to the fragrance either. I do believe that in the dry winter season, the skin needs vitamins for moisturizing and to keep your skin tone even. I struggle with dry and flaky skin.

Prior to getting the sample, my skin was feeling unusually dry and tight. Once I started using the 7 in 1 moisturizer, I noticed the dryness go away after about 4 days. It definitely helped to replenish the moisture in my skin while maintaining firmness. My skin felt much better, softer and brighter than the dull look it had before starting to use this product. With more moisturized skin I noticed a minimization of pores as well. I can not tell whether my fine lines or age spots have improved but again, my skin feels softer and more even over all. I liked how light this moisturizer feels right after application. I used in morning and night and did not notice any greasiness at all. It has a subtle scent that is not overpowering.

('I was so excited when my trail-size of Olay Total Effects 7 in One Anti-Aging Moisturizer arrived at my door. I could not wait to try it. I have been using the product for three days now and here are my initial thoughts. First off, the packaging is very nice. The pump appears very sturdy and distributes just the right amount of the moisturizer. Before I review the actual product, here are a few things about me. I am in my late thirties with combination skin - oily around the nose and chin and dry patches on my cheeks and forehead. My main concerns are uneven skin tone and appearance of some fine lines across my forehead. Now for the product... The moisturizer has a faint but very pleasant scent. It went on very smooth, however, it does feel a little heavier than I am used to. That being said, three days in and my skin does feel very soft and smooth.

("It's pretty fun to try out new products for my skin, especially before its available in stores. Having sensitive skin, I am not interested in wasting money on something that might not work for me, so this bzzkit was perfect for me! Olay Total Effects 7 in One Anti-Aging Moisturizer is not my favorite in terms of texture and how it feels on my skin but it is pretty nice overall in its application and performance. I find it works best for me when my skin is dry (like cold winter months) or even at night since it's a heavier face cream than I'm used to using. Normally I use a serum in the day time that is lightweight and I find this olay more penetrating on my skin and adds a bit more of a base I'd say it's perfect for foundation or pressed powder. I told my mom about Olay Total Effects 7 in One Anti-Aging Moisturizer since she's big into face creams and she tried a little bit on her skin. She liked it a lot!

The main feature I was excited about was that the cream was suppose to fight the fine lines and wrinkles. I'm in my early forties and I've noticed that I have a few lines between my brows and dark circles under my eyes. I've always fought against the dearness under my eyes do the brightening possibility also appealed to me. I have religiously used the cream once and sometimes twice a day since receiving my sample. The creme is a little on the think side which I prefer and it didn't take much to apply on my face. My skin felt moisturized and smooth, not sticky like some other brands I've used. So after a month of using this, I have noticed that the lines between my brows are less prominent but I don't see a change in the darkness/brightness of the skins under my eyes.

After using the cream for the allocated time I cant see any visual reduction in the fine lines but my face does feel more mosturised and I actually really love the cream.

It did not smell like sunblock, or unscented I can't put my finger on the scent it reminded me of. I have one very noticeable line below my eyebrow and this cream did not really reduce the appearance. Also, no lasting difference in the circles under my eyes.

("I was pleased to find out I would be receiving this product to test. I am very familiar with the Olay brand my grandmother used their products for years, and I currently have a bottle of their beauty fluid in my make-up drawer. I have very sensitive skin and this is always a concern when trying a new product. I initially tested the moisturizer on the skin on my hand and waited 24 hours before testing on my hand. There was no irritation, which was a great sign, as my hands were already sensitive to the cold weather and extra hand washing that winter brings. I did notice that it does have a fairly strong fragrance, as I noticed it throughout the morning on my testing hand. Even though I do have sensitive skin, I am a rather difficult customer, because I still do enjoy fragrance in my facial products. Because of this, I enjoyed the fresh scent, but it is worth noting that it was rather strong, and someone sensitive to scent might be bothered. The cream applied very smoothly to the skin on my faceI did not have to tug or blend heavily to rub it in. It felt very moisturizing and left my skin with a nice glow. I do have one age spot (so far!) and though I did take care to apply it to this spot, I have not noticed a decrease in its appearance. To be fair, I think more time would be beneficial for this task. I do find that my skin seems to have a nicer tone since wearing Total Effects, but I think I would need longer term use to find a radical change. For me, though, the chance to improve skin tone and fine lines without harsh ingredients is very appealing. I find retinol really bothers my skin, so the Olay is a good chance to find improvement without the irritation. I think this is a product I would consider purchasing and I think offering the trial size is a very smart option for people wanting to try something new without committing to a months-long regime that might not appeal. I have not yet tried an Olay product I didn't like and the Total Effects is no exception. I am pleased with the product so far, but the real test of time will be regular use over several months.

("Thanks to BzzAgent, I was given the chance to try out the Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer. This 15 mL trial size format comes with a wonderful pump to dispense the product (so no scooping out product from a jar and no losing product when you drop the container). The moisturizer itself is a very light pink color. The consistency of the moisturizer is thick, yet spreadable. I pumped out some of the product on the back of my hand and when I turned my hand over, the product didn't budge. This moisturizer leaves behind a completely matte finish (unlike the greasy aftermath left behind by my previous night cream). I don't notice immediate moisture to my skin after application, but after having the product on for a few hours my skin feels hydrated. So far, I have not had a problem with skin irritation. I have blemish-prone skin and this product has not caused any blemishes or redness. The packaging mentions that this product won't clog pores (because it's oil free) and fast-absorbing. I agree with both of these statements. with The formula of the Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer contains vitamins B3, B5, and E. A downside for some would be that the product also contains parabens. Be careful applying this around the eye area if you have oily eyelids as this product can really sting the eyes! Now as for the scent, it's light and mild. If you've used Olay Quench or Olay Complete basic moisturizers, the smell is kind of similar to those products. The fragrance is unnecessary especially since it's being applied to the face, which is why I'm giving this particular scented version 4 stars. For those with sensitive noses, I'd highly recommend going with the fragrance-free version. I've been using the Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer for 2 weeks now, so I can't report any dramatic effects (just yet). All I notice so far is increased hydration and radiance to my skin. The claims mentioned on this package (such as minimizing the look of pores, smoothing fine lines and wrinkles, and reducing age spots) would take more than a few weeks to see.

("I have recently been lucky enough to try a trial size of Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer thanks to Bzzagent. I am always wary of new creams since I tend to have reactions: noticeable redness or breakouts a few days after starting a routine. My skin needs the moisturizing agents found in all the creams but I have yet to find there right combination until now! The first thing I noticed about the cream was that it had a very pleasant, fresh and light scent. It did not feel heavy in my palm and came out smoothly from the pump (at first...we will come back to this later). I used two pumps for my first try and found that this was actually a little too much coverage so cut back to one pump for the remaining trial period and that worked just fine...and essentially doubled my usage of the bottle! I love that it went on very smooth and was easy to blend with no clumps and felt as light as air. It dried vey quickly so I was able to continue with my makeup routine without interruption which is essential since I only have a few minutes that I dedicate to this each morning. It did not leave a greasy residue like other products I've tried in true past but my skin still felt hydrated throughout the day. I have definitely noticed a brightness to my complexion since starting with Olay and am happy to report nourished skin and smoothness. I do have some fine lines around my eyes and although I haven't seen a dramatic improvement in this area I am happy with the other results and will continue using the product in the future. It also made it onto my Xmas wish list this year One of the drawbacks that I did notice, however, was the pump and bottle itself. Since this is a trial size that's not due out until February 2016, I'm not sure of the packaging for the full size version that is currently available. For my sample though, the pump seemed to leave residue so that if not cleaned after each use (or in some cases two uses) it ended to clump up at the spout which led to a crusty piece being pumped out along with the product I intended to use. Not ideal to have to dig through product to pull out the icky bits before applying, but if you remember to clean it wasn't an issue. All in all I found this to be a great product holding up to many of its claimed benefits! This review was collected as part of a promotion.", {'entities': [(57, 61, 'PRODUCT')]})
("I thought I'd share my final thoughts on the Olay Total Effects 7 in One Anti-Aging Moisturizer. I went into this campaign with mixed expectations because I have had issues with face moisturizers in the past where they just aren't made for really sensitive skin. The company advertises that - With its vitamin-rich formula, Olay Total Effects: Visibly smoothes fine lines and wrinkles Evens skin tone appearance Enhances brightness Minimizes the look of pores Visibly reduces age spots Restores firmness Replenishes moisture The result Skin that looks up to 10 years younger after just four weeks. Here are my thoughts... 1) Visibly smoothes fine lines and wrinkles: I did find that my skin was more hydrated and that did help with some of the finer lines that I've noticed starting to appear. I still have laugh lines but with the extra hydration they are softer. 2) Evens skin tone appearance: For me this was true, but the reason for that was they hydration - I live in the Canadian Prairies where we have had days of -18 C before the windchill -30 C with the wind chill - the extra hydration this product provided helped me to reduce the dry redness that my skin usually has this time of year. 3) Enhances brightness: I am not sure if my skin appears brighter but it is less dry which is a bonus! 4) Minimizes the look of pores: I haven't had issues with overly large pores so I haven't noticed much difference in this aspect. 5) Visibly reduces age spots: Again - I haven't had issues with Age Spots so I am not able to say how successful this product has been in this aspect. It hasn't had much effect on the freckles though :) 6) Restores firmness: I think with the renewed hydration your skin will, naturally, appear firmer. I am in my mid 30's so there hasn't been too much issue with loss of firmness at this point for me but I can see how the extra hydration helps. 7) Replenishes moisture: This product definitely meets and exceeds expectations on the moisture replenishment. My skin isn't as dry as it usually is this time of year and also appears healthier as a result. As someone with UBER sensitive skin, I really enjoyed this product, I didn't get a rash or itchiness from this product ( I wasn't using the sensitive skin one) so I will recommend this product to other users with sensitive skin who are looking to add hydration!

('OK this may end up being a longer review as I am going to try and keep a log and then post a couple of reviews on my thoughts. The Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturize lists the following claims: 1. Visibly smoothes fine lines and wrinkles 2. Evens skin tone appearance 3. Enhances brightness 4. Minimizes the look of pores 5. Visibly reduces age spots 6. Restores firmness 7. Replenishes moisture The result Skin that looks up to 10 years younger after just four weeks. These revitalizing vitamins include the anti-aging multi-tasker Niacinamide (Vitamin B3), soothing and moisturizing Panthenol (Vitamin B5) and conditioning agent Vitamin E with antioxidant properties. Here is a little background, I am 34 and a natural red head I live in the prairies which are now entering the chilly, dry winter months. I also suffer from sensitive skin so (as this product is scented) it will be interesting to see how my skin reacts. I have also never been a regular moisturizer user which I know isnt great for my skin. Week 1: I woke up put on a light application of the Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer. It has a really nice texture to it, although the fragrance is stronger than I usually use. As my husband isnt a big fan of flowery scents, Im using it in the morning rather than at night after my shower. The scent didnt seem to linger long and after walking out into the snow (yes, we had snow it was -8 C (17.6 F) when I left). Its now been over 3 hours since I first applied the moisturizer and so far so good. My skin isnt tingling or burning which is a nice treat the fragrance seems to have faded so I am hoping this luck will last (although Im not sure my husband will be too thrilled if I end up looking 10 years younger as Im already 10 years younger than he is.lol). Week 2: The scent is still not bothering my skin which is a huge bonus. So far I am finding that my skin is feeling smoother less dry. Week 3: I had a few days that I forgot to apply this product I noticed the difference in my skin. My skin began to feel tighter slightly flakey, typical Canadian winter skin sans moinsturizer. Week 4: Weve had slightly warmer weather so Im not sure if that has helped my skin or if its all courtesy of the Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer.. One of the lines in my face seems a little less prominent, so Im going to continue to see how things progress. I havent noticed much difference in my skin tone, but as someone with freckles, that doesnt really surprise me. My pores dont look any smaller I havent had issues with age spots as of yet. I look forward to seeing what the next few weeks hold. This review was collected as part of a promotion.', {'entities': [(131, 135, 'PRODUCT')]})
("When I first got this sample, I'm very curious if it really does all those 7 beautiful benefits that it claims. From what I remember from a long time ago when I used Oil of Olay skin care products in my 20s, it wasn't a very good experience and since then I haven't tried any of the Olay face products. Now that I'm in my mid 30s, I noticed I have more visible pores that is my number one concern. The first time I tried the moisturizer on, the first thing that I like was the scent. I'm quite picky or sensitive about the scent of skin care products. Some products are so fragrant that it gives you a headache all day. Even though I like the product itself, but sometimes the scent could be a huge downfall that I would have to pass. This Olay moisturizer has a very subtle, soft smell to it. Not too floral which I'm not a big fan of and most of the time it is what's in a lot of skin care products. I have combination skin so at times it's very shiny. I'm curious to see if this moisturizer would make my skin more shiny after I used it. Once I tried it, I loved it. It's not greasy or gives you that sticky heavy feeling that you have on your skin with a more heavy textured cream. The product gets absorbed into the skin very quickly and it leaves the skin feels very silky soft. After I put the this on, it actually makes it more easier for me to apply the SPF foundation on. The other brand of moisturizer that I was using before I guess doesn't put up to the test during the harsh winter weather, when I put the foundation on the dry skin flakes are even more noticeable. It was kind of frustrating. I noticed that my pores have improved, and my skin feels firmer. As for the claim that it smoothes fine lines and wrinkles, I can really comment on that because I don't have needs in that area yet...maybe in a few years. My skin tone appearance did get better. This product gives you a glow after you put it on. When I looked at the moisturizer closely, it's kind of tinted and it has some sparkly shine to it, but I'm glad that it's not tinted with colors. I prefer this more than tinted moisturizer that other brands offer because most of the time the color is not something that I like or it doesn't match my skin tone. I quite like the packaging of this product. It is much better and cleaner than putting your finger in a jar. With just one pump of it, it provides enough coverage for the face and neck area. Even though this is a little bit more expensive than other skin care products that drug store / grocery store carries, but it's worth the money I think with the amount that you need for each use. This product will actually last longer than other expensive products you can purchase. Great value overall! I would totally recommend this for people with combination skin from what I've experienced because it really does moisturize your skin without that sticky, greasy feeling it leaves on your skin as soon as you put it on. That's a big factor because you don't want your face to look oily when you go out. Therefore choosing the right product for the right type of skin is important. I'm actually very impressed with Olay this time around as compared to way back when. I used to get the sense that Olay is more for more matured ski, but this product totally changed my impression and perspective about the Olay brand itself. Now I kind of want to try the SPF formula that they offer. Wonder if the outcome would be the same. This review was collected as part of a promotion.", {'entities': [(173, 177, 'PRODUCT')]})

("The Holiday season brings with it parties, gatherings and get togethers, and often, the chance to reconnect with friends and family that we have lost touch with. Such is the case for me. I was invited to a house party just before Christmas and was surprised to bump into a former co-worker. After hugging and connecting the dots as to how each of us should end up at the same party, she grabbed my arm and said Kim! You look fabulous! Radiant! I thanked her of course, and then took the opportunity to introduce her, and a few other ladies within earshot to Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer. I always carry it with me for these very opportunities, so was able to pull it out of my purse and show it off. I explained how BzzAgent works, and that this was the latest product I received and was sampling. The name Olay is not not foreign and each of the ladies present started sharing their preferred Olay products. I told them how this vitamin-enriched cream glides on easily and absorbs nicely into the skin without leaving a sticky residue or feeling too heavy, that the vitamin B will help to visibly smooth fine lines, and that the brightening enhancer will help to minimize the appearance of pores and even out skin tone. While explaining all this, I took each lady's hand and pumped a small amount onto the backs of their hand and rubbed it in for them to see and feel for themselves. All were impressed at howsilky it felt, and how nice it smelled. All agreed with me that the bottle is fantastic durable, and no fingers in a jar. I told them how my skin feels hydrated, my skin tone is definitely evened out, and those fine lines seem less visible. We all cheered Yay for less visible fine lines. All agreed with me that this, like all Olay products, is a quality drugstore product, and most of the ladies present advised that they will be keeping their eyes peeled for it when it becomes available in February.

("Warning : long review ahead Okay, let's face it - I'm only 27, I don't exactly have any wrinkles. But Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer is anti-AGING so that's got to be beneficial in the long run, RIGHT! ... I think so! I wanted to take my sweet sweet time with this cream before I reviewed it. I made sure I wasn't using any similar products during testing in order to get its full benefits. So let's go through the seven signs of aging list to see what I thought... 1. Visibly smoothes fine lines and wrinkles - can't say that I had any to begin with... 2. Evens skin tone appearance - 100 YES!!! This is where I saw the best results. Before my skin was kind of blotchy. Mostly from scars due to acne but now they're not as noticeable. I'm not as self conscious as I was without foundation. Although you still won't find me in public without any! 3. Enhances brightness - I think this plays into the even skin tone category so yes, I believe it to be true. 4. Minimizes the look of pores - hmmm.. I never really noticed a difference to be honest. But it's not something I'm worried about on a daily basis. 5. Visibly reduces age spots - again, I'm pretty sure I didn't have any... 6. Restores firmness - I don't think my firmness needed restoring but my cheeks are as firm as a babies bottom ) 7. Replenishes moisture - definitely a moisturizing serum! I would almost go as far as to say slightly greasy though. I would like to add that the amount of serum you get from one pump is barely enough - 1.5 to 2 pumps is a must. Especially if you plan on using it on your neck and dcolletage. Also, it smells lovely! All in all, I think the positives outweigh the negatives. Especially if it's being used for a prolonged period of time (i.e. YEARS). To be honest, I haven't seen it on the shelf yet so until then (and unless the price is astronomical) I'll say that I'd buy it again!

("Where I live the weather here is really bad during the winter. My skin gets super dry and my face takes alot of the cold weather abuse, whether it be that I go out and play with the kids or going to the grocery store. Previous I was using a lotion on my face, but I found my face felt really heavy after applying it and it would clog my pores. I have been using Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer (trial size) for weeks now and I have to say at first I was very skeptical when I first got this product in the mail. One thing that really appealed to me was that it claimed it replenishes moisture, which I have to agree with. I only apply a small amount to cover my whole face, it stayed nice and moisturized and I didn't have any dry skin on my face. Plus it felt like my face was 'light weight' that putting this stuff on it didn't feel gunky on my face. Also one thing I noticed it gives my face the glow I had when I was pregnant, so with all the vitamins and nutrients in this product it really helps my face feel at its best. We take vitamins for our body, why not for our face! I do have fine lines on my face which I hate and I am starting to get the dreaded wrinkles. Since using this product I have noticed the lines on my face disappearing and being harder to see, which I love. I can not comment on all the signs that it helps aid in as I do not have any age spots as of yet, but so far for everything else I have seen a difference in my face. I know it won't work for everyone as everyone's body is made differently and reacts differently, but for me this products works. If you don't want to spend a lot to try it, I would recommend buying the trial size version before buying a full size bottle. The only thing you have to lose is dry skin, wrinkles, fine lines, uneven skin tone and age spots, it is worth a try in my books.

("Just received this trial size Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer last night. I was really bummed that I had already showered and so I had to wait until this morning to actually use it! Every time I'm in the skin care aisle at the store, I always pause at the Olay display. Now I finally get to try it. So first things first - I am a sucker for packaging. I find the Olay packaging looks very 'mature' and premium (which is probably what they are going for, in which case they nailed it). The pump is easy to use, and dispenses the proper amount. Just a note that it took several (8-10) pumps to work the air out of the straw and for the product to come out. Don't give up! ) I always put my face cream on fresh out of the shower so it goes on easier and I use less. This cream was no different. At first I felt like it sat a bit heavier on my skin than I'm used to, but once it was fully absorbed that feeling went away. It makes my skin feel smooth, and has a pleasant smell - bonus! I don't have a super regular skin care routine, and I am blessed with young skin (in fact, I was just ID-ed buying cigarettes the other night. I'm 29!) so I'm not sure how many fine lines or wrinkles I have. However I am interested to see if it will help even my skin tone, enhance brightness and reduce the look of my pores (all claims on the box!) I took a 'before' picture prior to applying it for the first time this morning, and will apply it regularly for four weeks or until I run out of product, then take an 'after' photo. I will write a second review at that time with my thoughts! This review was collected as part of a promotion.", {'entities': [(30, 34, 'PRODUCT')]})

I was hesitant at first because the least part of my body that I would have experiment is my face, but then as one of my first projects I finally did try it. It wasn't what I expected it to be it's not oily and heavy, just light and I think it did even gave me a powder finish, my face isn't that oily as before. I waited for like a couple more weeks for maximum result, right now its been my third week and haven't got any zitz so far ( thank God!) so I guess it isn't really oily and it doesn't clog pore as contrary to my first belief. With the fine lines, I really can't tell that 'cause right now I believe with my age I don't have them yet ( thanks God again!). Skin tone Yea I guess it made my skin fairer and brighter. Age spots not really.. 'cause I don't have them yet just like with the fine lines but hey it did made my dark spot go away! really! so if you have pimple marks I suggest you use Olay religiously! And I also believe that it minimize the looks of my pores specially in my pore head and made my skin softer and radiantly fair! So I guess all in all it's worth your money though I know they're a bit pricey.

("I admit, I was skeptical when I received the Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer and the promises they made but I was more tan pleasantly surprised after trying it for a few weeks. Now, I can't tell you exactly how many weeks it was but I can assure you it was a minimum of 2 weeks. Since I'd been approaching 40 I started to notice a change in my skin. The pores were larger, the firmness wasn't what it used to be and what I lovingly referred to as freckles were just ugly age spots. Now I used the Olay Total Effects in conjunction with a great facial cleansing machine (which allows whatever product you aaply to be absorbed more deeply into the skin) and I'm in LOVE. I will admit I don't look like I'm 25 but I have seen a real improvement, so much that I ended up buying another bottle so I can continue with the skin care. My pores are WAY smaller and therefore less noticeable. Those freckles aka age spots are almost nonexistent and while I can't say my skin is as firm as it was in my 20's there is more moisture in it therefore at the very least giving my skin the appearance of being softer and firmer. The moisturizer gives my fantastic moisture without making my face look and feel like an oil slick. I have a physically demanding job and when I used other moisturizers I would find my face looked like I'd slathered it in EVOO by the end of my shift. Not a good look. Now I have a dewy look and a wonderfully touchable face. If there are any doubters reading this I suggest you stop doubting and give it a try. I'm sure you'll love it as much as I do!

I was excited to try a new product from Olay as any experiences I had had in the past were positive! Here are the claims and what I thought after use: 1. Visibly smoothes fine lines and wrinkles - while I don't have any deep wrinkles, I do have some fine lines around my mouth and eyes, that I felt were lessened/less noticeable after repeated use. 2. Evens skin tone appearance - I feel like I am having to use a little less concealer, so this must be working as well. Without any make up on, my skin does appear more uniform as well. 3. Enhances brightness - I do feel as if my skin has a nice healthy glow. 4. Minimizes the look of pores - I am not really sure, as not a concern of mine. 5. Visibly reduces age spots - Not something I am concerned with, so also cannot comment. 6. Restores firmness - My skin isn't really saggy, but it did have a nice look to it after use. 7. Replenishes moisture - Now THIS was my selling point! My skin really suffers in the winter time - with use of the Olay Total Effects 7 in 1, my skin was VERY moisturized and didn't show any of the usual signs I tend to have like dry flaky skin! I did not notice any issues with break outs, even though this is a very moisturizing cream, but again, my skin tends to be dry in the winter.

Love the effects on my face non greasy, very light on the skin , it has mild fresh scent , and you can wear it all day without looking oily because it absorbs fast , It has a mild feeling but potent effect on the skin.I will surely have a merry and glowing Christmas .

("We are bombarded with products that claim to fight one thing or another when it comes to skin care. While I have used many different products, none have matched the quick (and I mean quick) results that I have seen with Olay's Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer. It's a moisturizer that can work day or night with a nutrient formula needed for skin. I used it mainly as a night moisturizer but it can be worn all day. The product smell is gentle and pleasant so it's not a medicated smell or overpowering. The applicator pump itself gives you just enough product you need which I think is a great way to control any possible adverse effects like breakouts with overusing the product . For someone with sensitive skin like myself, this is a HUGE help that takes away the guess work. While trying this product, I did not get one breakout so that's been a huge bonus for me. For the results, while I did not wrinkles to actually notice any difference I did see quite a remarkable difference in my skin specially with dark spots and skin tone. I have been an avid user of the Clinique Dark Spot Corrector which I cannot use for prolonged periods of time because of breakouts. But the Olay Total Effects have worked much better in shorter period of time and I see a HUGE difference in the way my skin looks and feels.

I'm 36, not far off her age back then, but I still had it stuck on my head that it was not quite for me yet. I was so very wrong. First off, that tiny tube has lasted me for well over a month, one pump per day was all that was necessary. It comes out easily, is very light and has a really nice gentle smell. Not at all what I expected. I'm lucky enough to not really have any wrinkles, but I have noticed my complexion is balanced (I have combo skin), not too greasy, but not tight and dry which I've alway had a hard time maintaining with other products. I also noticed a huge reduction in how noticeable pores were, especially on my nose, as well as how just generally bright and glowy my skin looks. I absolutely love the small size, I travel a lot and it's perfect. I'm actually leaving for two weeks in a few days and I'm sad to say I think it's not gonna make it that long. I'll have to pick up a larger one for now. I will get the one with sunscreen though, that was really the only thing that would have made this better. All in all, this is a great inexpensive moisturizer that really produced genuine noticeable results. I would (and have) recommend it to a friend in a second and it compares very will to some more expensive ones I have used. It's most definitely not only my mom's moisturizer any more!

My initial thoughts of the moisturizer were that it went on smoothly and it was very light. The consistency of the moisturizer is light and non-greasy. It absorbs quickly and easily into the skin. The moisturizer does have a nice fresh scent that I really enjoy. It is not at all overwhelming (though I am not sensitive to scents and those who are might feel it is too strong). Honestly, I did not notice a difference in my skin after the first few days, nor did I expect to see one. However, after about a week, I did notice that my skin felt more supple. Some of my fine lines were slowly diminishing - not completely invisible, but definitely less apparent. I don't have any deep set wrinkles - yet - and so, I cannot comment on whether this moisturizer works well to minimize deep wrinkles. I think it is a good all in one product. I am not sure of what the price will be once it is on the shelf, and thus, I cannot say whether it is a good value compared to other similar products. However, I think if you're spending money on anti-aging products and moisturizers that you use separately, you can definitely save money by using just the one product that targets more than one skin concern.

I was totally satisfied with how it felt on my skin, no irritation or redness at all , and I have sensitive skin. I could actually feel how much more moisture was going into my skin. There was no greasy feel afterwards, in fact it absorbs very quickly and feels like you have put a great deal of the product on your skin even after only 1- 1.5 little pumps of lotion in your hands. It spreads very well and , again , I can't say enough about how smooth and soft my skin feels after I use it. The fact that it has a built in sunscreen is just a total bonus! I have a really sensitive sense of smell and perfumes make me sick so I loved the fact that it is fragrance-free . This cream makes my skin feel soft, it balances out my uneven tones and even made the bags under my eyes less visible in under a week. NO JOKE! My kids even say I look better and asked what I did different. I was unsure about the size of the trial bottle but it lasts way longer than I expected, even when using 2 pumps at a time!( but really , 1 pump was enough to cover my whole face) I sometimes use a have pump and dab my wrinkles, bags and lines you can actually see the difference in a few days. It was nice to get an anti ageing product that ACTUALLY does was it says it's supposed to do. I normally don't like to spend a great deal on face creams, but this is one I will buy regularly.

I have already noticed that it has helped in the reduction of visibility of my age spots which really impressed me as I am very skeptical of any product that claims that. Also it is a sulfate free formula which is another good feature as many facial products contain and if you have allergies to sulfate you break out in a rash.

("Knowing how much I love Olay moisturizer and how gentle it's been on my skin (I've been using their original beauty fluid since the age of 15), I was very excited to try a FREE sample of Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer for review. With its vitamin-rich formula, Olay Total Effects purports to do the following: - Visibly smoothes fine lines and wrinkles - Evens skin tone appearance - Enhances brightness - Minimizes the look of pores - Visibly reduces age spots - Restores firmness - Replenishes moisture Upon initial use, I found the product to have a nice light scent and a smooth, velvety texture. The consistency was a little thicker than the moisturizer I normally use so I was hesitant at first to use it as my skin is easily irritated. However, I found it absorbed very well. Like any woman, I scrutinize my face on a regular basis. I noticed right away that my face felt immediately softer. While the fine lines remained after 3 weeks of use, I did notice that my skin seemed brighter within a week. I imagine if I was able to test a full-sized sample for a longer period of time, I would have noticed a bigger difference.

('My first reaction to the packaging was HOW CUTE!! Such a great idea making a trial sized version of this cream! So compact and small enough to carry in my purse! Olay total Effects 7 in 1 Anti aging Moisturizer is a brilliant product! Perfect amount in one pump. You only need max three pumps to cover your face and targets every problem zone! I have lines and uneven skin tone and within using it for almost three weeks I have already seen a great improvement! Smoother lines, not so visible and age spots much lighter than they were three weeks ago! On top of that, left my skin feeling perfectly moisturized without the oily residue! Love this product!

Restores firmness 7. Replenishes moisture The fine lines in the corners by my mouth has disappeared. My skin tone which was relatively even before looks better. My skin is brighter and it glows. No longer seeing large pores on my nose. I had no age spots to be reduce. My face seems firmer and my dehydrated skin is well moisturized. This product is not a hoax, it works. I highly recommend this product. I will be definitely be buying this product when my free product is finished.

("Right from the first time I applied Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer, my skin was so soft...it felt like silk!! Within a couple of days, I did notice those fine, little lines around my eyes lessen and within a week almost totally erased. My skin tone improved giving me an even, brighter tone throughout my face...lightening the circles under my eyes. My cheeks and mouth area also have reduced wrinkles and are noticeably firmer. I love the light, fresh scent not overpowering and impressed how fast-absorbing it is. The pores on my nose seems like they're almost gone....they've decreased in size and never got clogged. Truly a wonderful product that tackles many little problems all in one cream. My skin has never felt or looked so good!!

So I was excited to try it again and am happy to report that it works just as well as it used to. As a day time moisturizer it is perfect, not too greasy or oily, doesn't make my skin too dry, has a very pleasant scent. All things I love in a moisturizer. Although I still like my Regenerist as my go to daily moisturizer I am not oppose to using Total Effects, or any other moisturizer that Olay makes.

I know that they say 4 weeks to notice a difference but as far as the smoothness of my skin I have already noticed a difference. I have very sensitive skin and so far have had no issues. There is no overwhelming odor and it goes on feeling lovely with no greasy feeling after. Since using the sample I have ceased using anything else as far as moisturizer.

Just because I break out a week into using a new cream doesn't make it the cream's fault. Most likely it's hormonal or response to stress. So I've given Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer weeks to work it's magic, and yes, magic indeed. I have normal skin, albeit a tad on the sensitive side. I do not suffer from constant break outs or enlarged pores. I do have issues with dryness around my nose and chin, and creeping closer to 40 (yikes), I've found my wrinkles want to stand out and be noticed. This moisturizer not only alleviated the dryness around my nose and chin, but I've noticed the wrinkles around my eyes and mouth have actually lessened!! I waited a good long time before I made this judgement. Wanting something often makes you see things that aren't there, but this time, my mind wasn't playing tricks on me! The cream is not heavy, and it smells nice and light (not like some 'old lady' creams I've used before). It did not cause any redness or rashes on my sensitive skin. And a little goes a long way!!

("I think that Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer lives up to it's claims in helping you look up to 10 years younger with some special bonuses! The first thing that I noticed about this product was the scent. It's very light and almost soothing. After using it just for one week, I began to notice those fine lines disappearing. With continued use, the fine lines are nearly gone and the larger wrinkles have become very minimized. I've tried everything from the cheap and cheerful, to the high end spa lines and not one product has been able to help me achieve results like this and as quickly. The nourishing vitamins that this product is packed with are a clear winner! The only negative thing that I would say is that the trial size bottle spout clogs slightly but it has no effect on the product inside, thus, I will not take away from my rating. The product itself is not greasy, not heavy, nor does it take forever to rub into your skin. A quick, gentle rub on your cheeks and you're wrinkles are done! This is not some complicated, time consuming, overpriced skin regime that makes it a chore to take care of your face.

I been using this for only a few weeks, but since then my skin texture was transformed. I use to have many dry patches, and dark spots. I'm only 27 but skincare is extremely important to me. I'm very picky when it comes to skin care products. Olay is the only drugstore brand I find that actually works and is worth buying. I would recommend this moisturizer. It's not too greasy, it really sinks into the skin when you put it on. It's Fragrance Free, which is so important for facial products. This is my favorite Olay Moisturizer!

I don't really see much happening as far as wrinkles as concerned however, I do see other benefits that would make me purchase this product. After using Olay Total Effects for a few days my skin felt very well hydrated but not greasy. This moisturizer absorbs quickly without leaving a greasy feeling and was great worn under makeup. I also felt that my skin felt and looked smoother and my pores were definitely minimized. I had some friends even comment that my skin looked more radiant the usual.

This didn't irritate my psoriasis on my forehead either, so that was a bonus. I found the redness in my checks was not as pronounced the texture of my skin started to become more even and it moisurized like it was supposed to.

I had a friend come from out of state to stay with me for a couple weeks and she tried mine and now she is hooked also.

After only using this product for 2 days, I've already been asked by two family members what I've been using on my skin! I've been told that my skin is glowing, my pores looks smaller and my skin tone looks more even. I was mostly interested in finding a product that will smooth out my skin and lighten some spots. This moisturizer does that and more! It didn't make me break out or irritate my skin.

I wish :) but I can say it did soften the fine lines and made my skin look brighter and more glowy than I can remember.

It has a nice texture and isn't too thick for someone with acne-prone, combination skin. - Many beneficial ingredients - antioxidants, niacinamide, and other ingredients that help combat the signs of aging.

It goes on smooth, isn't too thick or thin (good consistency), has a pleasant fragrance that isn't overpowering, and moisturizers quite well. Although, I find in the winter months, I could use a tad more moisture on my skin. As to all the benefits that apparently come with using the cream, I'm a bit skeptical. I haven't noticed my fine lines or wrinkles improve and didn't really notice a difference with reducing the appearance of pores. I also don't really see a restoration of firmness either. That said, I don't really believe there is a moisturizer that can actually do all of the things Olay claims to be able to do.

But don't think that because it is light weight that it means that it is not doing its job. I have notice an improvement in my skins tone and general appearance. I have also noticed that the few lines that I do have around my eyes and the worry line on my forehead looks less noticeable.

It's minimized the fine lines that I had and evened out the overall appearance of my skin. I feel like I have that natural glow.....without the makeup. The one thing that I love about this product was how it kept my skin moisturized. I can't stress how dry my face was and now that we are into our winter months it counts on keeping it extra moisturized. I love this product. Plus it's much less expensive than the brand I was using before. Before trying this out I had high hopes. My current brand wasn't giving me the results that I wanted and the ones before that, same thing! I'm so happy I got invited to this campaign. i'll never go back to the other brands.

During this campaign I have mentioned it to many family and friends as I have over the years and encouraged those that haven't already purchased Olay products to give them a chance because I have found that they are the best products to see lasting results over many years of use. They might not be great for short term fast effects but for the long term they are excellent. Most people that I talk to about Olay products are very open to trying them and many have become long term users over the years. I feel like I am always telling people how great Olay products are so i guess you could say that I buzz about them constantly not just during this campaign :) I will continue to be an Olay user for years to come, I am always excited to see what kinds of products they are coming up with and am usually the first to try the new creams they release.

It is a light moisturiser which spreads easily with a loght scent but doesn't irritate my overly sensitive skin. As with other reviews I've read, one pump is enough to cover my face and neck completely. I like how it has a pump instead of dipping your fingers into a pot which makes it hygenic! It makes my skin feel really smooth and not only gives it a healthy appearance it feels healthier and my pores look smaller. I've already recommended this to my friends and family because i trult do believe they need to try this out for themselves so they can then see the benefits that the Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer has to offer!!

("I haven't had a chance to use the product for the full four weeks to really comment on the 7 benefits of the product, but so far I like what I'm using! I'm pretty picky about my face products and was a strict Biotherm girl! However, I really think I could switch to Olay after this. First of all there is the price point differnce between my usual brand and Olay. Olay is much more affordable than Biotherm. Secondly, I love the way my skin feels right now. I can't say if it's fighting off those fine lines as I sit here and type this, but I can say that I have much smoother skin and the tone feels more even! I find that my skin doesn't dry out as fast using Olay. Normally the air is much drier at this time of year and I need to get my skin treatment on my face as soon as I get out of the shower or my face gets very flakey. I find now with Olay I can wait a few minutes before jumping into my skin care routine and by the time I put on my pressed powder my skin is still soft and not dry. The moisture level is great! Overall I give this product an A+ and I will certainly buy it when I run out of the sample size! This review was collected as part of a promotion.", {'entities': [(266, 270, 'PRODUCT')]})
("Winter time in Canada is upon us, and with the cold weather comes wood heating. Wood heating means dry skin. Finding a good moisturizer has always been a tedious task for myself, I've never found a product that will help keep my face moisturized without leaving a greasy looking residue, until now. Since I've started using Olay Total Effects, I haven't had any dry skin on my face at all! It doesn't leave any greasy residue behind, it goes on smoothly, dries quickly, and it does all this without drying out sensitive facial skin. I've also noticed that since I started using Olay Total Effects, the unique vitamin complex has definitely helped even out my uneven skin tone cause by sun exposure, past scaring and aging! This is absolutely a product I would recommend to anyone who's looking for a great moisturizer, with a ton of added benefits to fight the 7 signs of aging!

("Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer has renewed me! I think that over the last few weeks my life has changed dramatically. LET'S FACE IT...no one likes getting older. This year I turned 40 and I noticed little lines and a dullness to my complexion that seemed to sneak up over night. Lucky for me, I was chosen to try Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer for the last month. Today I am happy to say that I look younger and refreshed. I can easily leave my house without makeup and for once I don't stress what others see. I have a new found confidence. Hard Canadian winters tend to make my skin dry and flaky. This is the first winter my skin is flake free and soft. Even my husband noticed the difference...lets keep the secret between us. Bottom line...my lines are softer, age spots are a thing of the past and my face is brighter and my skin tone is even...best part is moisture for days! Ps. The pump is easy to use, and the scent is light and divine. TWO thumbs way up...thanks Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer and Buzz Agent for letting me try it for free...I am hooked This review was collected as part of a promotion.", {'entities': [(0, 4, 'PRODUCT')]})
('I received the sample and I just finished my second week of using it day and night so going on my third week. At first when using Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer i did not really care for it, it seemed like it did not have enough moisturizing to it, but I gave it a chance still and especially night time I found the results much better for moisturizing. I can see that my tone is evening out slightly right now and my skin feels great. I find the sample is plenty to use, one suggestion to those who are using this product or any product is that a little goes a long way, never understood why people think that they should coat their face with a thick layer of cream or lotion when less then half the amount of that works great. I find one pump of the Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer is plenty enough to see results. Going on week 3 as I stated at the start of this post. Looking forward to seeing what new surprise I see each day I wake up :). But thus far really like the product, does not have a major fragrance smell to it and seems quite gentle to the skin. One pump is all it takes. See you in 2 weeks for a complete update. This review was collected as part of a promotion.', {'entities': [(130, 134, 'PRODUCT')]})
("I have been using a variety of different moisturizers from Aveeno to Dermologica and I have to say that I am so very happy to have finally found a moisturizer I love in Olay Total Effects! It goes on silky, doesn't sting or irritate my somewhat sensitive skin - major plus! The scent is lovely and not overwhelming- I have had problems with scents in the past giving me headaches so I am so pleased this does not happen with Olay Total Effects. My skin feels smooth and most importantly- my skin feels replenished/hydrated the colour seems even and not blotchy. I love every aspect of this moisturizer and I am using it morning and night.

("This new Olay product is the real deal. Ive been using my free sample as a day cream for a week now and thanks to the unique recipe of vitamins (Niacinamide (Vitamin B3), Panthenol (Vitamin B5) and antioxidant Vitamin E ), my skin is already noticeably less red, more fully moisturized and even-looking. The texture of Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer is perfect -- it goes on easily, its not too oily or gloppy and it doesn't leave your skin feeling dry. There's no stinging or redness (a real shocker since my skin is super sensitive, and this is a drug store brand). It works well under make-up, I tried it successfully as a primer under two different make-up counter products. It has already healed up some dry spots that arrived with cold dry winter air. The only downside: my sample is scented, next time I'll try the unscented option. I'm looking forward to saying goodbye to those irritating signs of aging: fine lines, age spots and uneven skin tone they say it takes about four weeks to see the full benefits of this great new product .

("I have seen Olay Total Effects in the stores I shop at for beauty products multiple times. I've even picked it up and debated buying it. For some reason I always ended putting it back on the shelf and going to my usual skin cream which just so happens to be another Olay product. Recently my usually skin cream seems to be reacting with my skin and causing dryness and flaking. I started putting less on to see if it would help but it didn't seem to do the trick. I couldn't stand not putting any cream on either because naturally I have dry skin and I can't stand dry itchy skin on my face. I was all to keen on trying the Olay Total Effects when it arrived in the mail. I was using it the very same day it arrived. I lathered it on my skin and by lathered I mean I applied it thick, I just wanted to see what it could do!

This has been a source of embarrassment for me over the past few years, because it could not be covered by make up and I'm not that old!! It first appeared during my pregnancy 4 years ago and I never thought that it would go away. It's still not completely gone, but I feel that with regular usage, I could reduce it even further. I am SO thankful for this. I wish I had taken a before and after shot. I have not noticed it reducing my fine lines yet, but I expect that it will over time.

("I started using Olay Total Effects moisturizer when I was 35 years old that was many years past. I stopped 2 years ago since I was also experimenting on different kinds of brand i let go of it. Its not always included in my budget. The thing is once you reached the age of 40, you will notice fine lines, wrinkles, youthful skin no more. Since Bzz Agent offered me to try and review Olay Total Effects definitely its a yes! Its like seeing your long lost love and be reunited once more. When using the moisturizer gently pat it on your face, no rubbing please. It will penetrate more in your skin with its unique vitamin complex ingredients. The result is absolutely the same as it was before, reduced fine lines, even skin tone, youthful looking skin with a glow! I am now in need to get the full size bottle to make up with my lost years! I highly recommend it to the beautiful ladies who's life begins at 40! Be fabulous! This review was collected as part of a promotion.", {'entities': [(16, 20, 'PRODUCT')]})
("I think that the Olay Effects 7 in 1 is a miracle worker. Like you , I've tried many different products and home remedies. None of those had worked for me. When I became pregnant a little over 2 years ago , I had the pregnancy dark spots on my face and my face was just plainly discoloured all over. My sleeping had gotten worse and the bags under my eyes had gotten even darker. I had swelled up so much that my skin started to sag. After having my son and my body got back to itself again, the nurses and doctor had assured me that my skin would return to normal and the dark spots would go away within a few months. It's been over 2 years and finally I've found a product to take away the uneven skin tone , reduce the colour of my dark spots that were supposed to go away , firmed up my skin , reduced the deeply embedded lines. If that wasn't a big enough bonus for me , I finally get to throw all my facial creams in the garbage and put that money to use elsewhere. Of course some of the money freed up will be used for Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer. This review was collected as part of a promotion.", {'entities': [(17, 21, 'PRODUCT')]})

("Olay is a product that has always been in my house. My mother used it, my grandmother used and I have used it from a young age. It is a name that I know I can trust for reasonable prices and quality. Olay never gives my skin a reaction and always does what it says. This product is no different. Olay Total Effects 7 claims to visibly smooth lines and wrinkles which I believe that it does. It evens the tone of my skin which is does. I often have redness and this products calms that. It enhances brightness and makes my skin appear healthier. It mildly reduces the appearance of pores. It helps with age spots and firmness in my mom's skin and replenishes moisture. No, this product is not a miracle worker. You won't wake up with a new face, however, you can trust that your skin will be protected, moisturized and will not react.

("I have been using Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer for a couple of weeks now. I loved it after the first day. It has a lovely soft scent to it and the pump that I was given with my free trial pumps out the perfect amount. I am 42 years old with 2 small sons so looking after my skin hasn't been a priority lately. So the difference when I started using it was big! Almost immediately I noticed that it evens out skin tone and restores firmness and my skin appeared brighter and healthier. I have combination oily and dry skin and often moisturizers result in me having a greasy face, however not at all with this product. There is the perfect amount of moisture restored using this. I haven't noticed any change in the appearance of the few age spots I have, however it has only been a couple weeks so I don't expect a miracle! lol. I look forward to continue using this product. I got it free, however I plan to buy it once my sample is all used up. Thank you BzzAgent for letting me try this product, what a great first product to try!

("I have never tried Olay before but I am very pleased with this product! Me: I have sensitive-combo skin. Prone to blemishes and can be dry during the winter. The Product: This comes in a hygenic pump applicator. I have found one pump gives enough product to use on my face and neck. The cream itself is quite thick and took a little longer to soak in than others. It has a pleasant light fragrance. A little goes a long way. The first time I applied 2 pumps and was left looking a bit white and pale like I was wearing thick sun screen. One pump is plenty! Effects: I was very surprised at how gentle this is! When I first tried it I had a terrible cold and my nose was very sore / raw but when I applied this it didn't sting at all. It has got rid of my dry skin without leaving me feeling greasy. I've had no reaction and I can apply makeup on top of it without any streaks or smudges (as long as I let it completely soak in first). Overall: very pleased. It is light enough for you to forget you have it on but strong enough to keep your skin moisturised, soft and smooth.

("When I first started using Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti Aging Moisturizer, I liked it but I didn't love it. Now that I have finished using the trial bottle, I have definitely noticed a huge improvement in my skin and it looks so much better without makeup. My skin tone is much more even and my fine lines are less noticeable. It was especially helpful with my forehead wrinkles as they seem more plumped up. At first, I wasn't too happy with the scent of this cream but it really does grow on you. It smells very fresh and the scent eventually disapates so it's really not too bad. I love how easy it is to spread on my face as it has a light, smooth texture. I use this after my Olay Daily Facials and my skin feels like its been treated at a spa. I am very glad that I was able to try this Olay Moisturizer through BzzAgent as I love its effects and I will definitely be incorporating this into my skin care regimen.

("I loved this stuff! My skin is ultra sensitive, but I found this moisturizer to perfectly compliment my combination skin type. All I needed was a tiny dab to perfectly nourish my skin. I loved how it really reduced my pores and evened out my skin. It even somehow seemed to reduce my oiliness! I wore it both alone and under my makeup, and it didn't melt like most moisturizers. It felt light and airy. I also liked that it didn't have any SPF in it. Some people swear by it, but I seem to react to it so it's nice to have that option. It also didn't make me break out in acne as most moisturizers tend to do. How I'd rate this: Visibly smoothes fine lines and wrinkles: N/A (no wrinkles on this face...yet!) Evens skin tone appearance: 5/5 Enhances brightness: 4/5 Minimizes the look of pores: 5/5 Visibly reduces age spots: 5/5 (no age spots, but my freckles could be comparable) Restores firmness: N/A Replenishes moisture: 5/5 Would I buy this When I did some research recently on the top moisturizers for my type of skin, Olay was up in the Top 5 so, YES, definitely!

("I've been using my sample of Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer for one and a half weeks now, and I love it! My face feels smoother and softer. I never had very dry skin, but it is more evenly moisturized now. It goes on nice and smooth, not greasy or thick, but not runny either, and it has a pleasant, delicate scent, which lingers just long enough. The pump dispenser on the sample bottle dispenses an appropriate amount, too, so I can use a little on my neck as well. My skin tone seems a little more even...hard to tell, but I haven't been using it very long. I don't have many wrinkles or age spots (yet!), but using this product for longer may give better results to reduce the ones I do have! I already use Olay Complete face moisturizer with SPF 15 daily, but Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 is many, many times better. The sample doesn't have any SPF, so when it is available I will be buying the one that has sun protection.

('Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer.. I was on the fence with it.. I wasnt sure it really did much for my skin.. Then i stopped using it for a couple days and my skin took notice! I hadnt realized but with it my skin stayed clearer, less oily, my pores were tighter and my skin as a whole just felt more firm. Im only 32 and have only a few lines so far but never really pictured myself using an anti-aging cream of any sort.. But I am now hooked.. Without the nightly moisturizer my skin changed so much for the worse.. My pores were more obvious and i started having a couple breakouts because my skin was becoming oily again. I definately reccomend any Olay product normally (i swear by the bodywash!) but this Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 has for sure earned a strong recommendation from me and is both fragrance-free and with sunscreen broad spectrum SPF 15.

("So, for someone who is a moisturize twice a day kind of girl, I though this would be the same old gimmick. I have always felt that as long as you moisturize, it really doesn't matter the product. Well, apparently I have been wrong. I actually can see a difference! I received and started Olay Total Effects on November 17 2015 and because I am going away (tropical) today, I felt I needed to take my after photo now as it wouldn't be right if I came back tanned hahaha. Anyways after 10 days I actually see (slightly) but still... a difference. Olay total effects took the fine lines and crows feet away. I am not sure how much this is in the store but I am actually going to buy a product I tried from BzzzAgent for the first time! I like the smell of the product, I LOVE the dispenser too!

She came over to me and said Gee, your skin has such a smooth soft texture Di...what are you doing I explained to her and her friends about Olay Total Effects and about testing this for BZZ.

I don't like applying cream to my face and have a strong smell that I notice all day. It applies very nice, smooths out easily and absorbs very well.You don't need to use much product at all. It made my face feel so smooth and hydrated right away which is amazing because any other cream I have used doesn't do that. This moisturizer also helped with redness I get on my face every winter. I have noticed after about 3 days that the redness is much less.I noticed throughtout the day that my face is not drying out like it normally would during the cold days. My face would normally dry out and you could notice the dry skin but using the Olay Total Effects 7-in One anti-aging Moisturizer has had such a great improvement that my face stays hydrated much longer now.I love this product and would highly recommend it!

I didn't see results straight away but after 12 days of using it I started to notice my skin was bright and smooth I don't really have fine lines right now but prevention is better the cure I think. After 17 days of using the Olay total effects 7 in 1 moisturizer I was sold my skin felt great and looked awesome. I was really pleased the moisturiser didn't make me break out like a few others ive previously tried, my pores looked smaller and my skin felt firmer.

My honest opinion I LOVE it!! I apply it in the morning after my shower and after my skin cleaning ritual in the evening. It is relatively scent free, which is great for those with scent sensitivity. It soaks into my skin in seconds. My coworkers have commented that I look younger (yay...I love my work peeps) which I attribute to Olay's claim of brightened skin The fine lines around my eyes and laugh lines around my mouth are barely visible after 3 weeks of daily use.

("In my original review, I was planning on doing a side by side, before/after comparison. I have been using the product daily for 3-4 weeks, but unfortunately don't see significant changes that would warrant a comparison. To be fair, I had been using a Neutrogena anti-aging cream for several months before I got this campaign (and a different Olay face cream for years before that). Therefore, I don't think there was much 'reversing' that needed to be done. What it DID do was keep my face soft and moisturized all day and throughout the night, and maintained the 'work' that had been done for years before that. In other words, it's on par with the other stuff I already use. It bears repeating that it's light and fluffy, and smells delish so it may well be something that I switch to in the future (once my other products run out). As always, it will be dependent on price but the other lotion I use isn't cheap so that probably isn't hard to beat. It keeps its initial 5/5 stars :) This review was collected as part of a promotion.", {'entities': [(342, 346, 'PRODUCT')]})

("I have been using Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer for a few weeks now and I love it! Since I have been using the Total Effects, I have noticed that my skin is softer. It also appears to be a little brighter. The tone is evened-out, as well. I sometimes get a little redness around my cheeks and nose that has diminished drastically. I have some fine lines across my forehead that seem smaller now, especially if I moisturize before bedtime This is THE perfect product for my skin and age (40-ish.) It provides a light, non-greasy moisturizer, blends my pale/uneven skin tone into a nice healthy-looking color, and doesn't 'fill in' the crinkles wrinkles like a foundation does. I hope Olay never discontinues this fine product. The formula, with its VitaNiacin Complex, fights the 7 signs of aging and gently exfoliates your skin with vitamins B3, B5, C and E. This multi-tasking daily moisturizer gives you 7 skin benefits for younger, healthier-looking skin in 1 simple step by combining humectants and skin conditioners to help keep skin hydrated. Its vitamins and antioxidants defend against free radicals, help reduce the look of age spots, instantly minimize and refine the appearance of pores, and reduce the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles. This facial moisturizer nourishes with hydration to visibly reduce the signs of aging by subtly lifting the skin - enhancing and evening out skin tone for a more youthful appearence. This is Olay's simple, smart approach to younger, healthier-looking skin for life, combining: 7 benefits in 1 helps keep skin at its youthful radiant best VitaNiacin Complex, with vitamins B, C and E exfoliates to enhance skin's natural self renewal process for healthier-looking skin in 4 weeks Oil free and will not clog pores Fast absorbing, non-greasy formula 1 Brilliant Product: 7 Beautiful Benefits 1.

("I received a trial sample of Olay Total Effects Anti-Aging Moisturizer form BzzAgent for my honest opinion. I gave this product the ultimate test -- over the last 3 weeks (that was how long the sample bottle lasted) every night after removing makeup and washing my face, I used the Olay sample on my left face, while I continued to follow my normal skincare routine on the right. My regular routine consists of the following steps: 1) SK-II beauty essence (everyone who is of Asian descent will know of this premium Max Factor line from Japan), 2) Estee Lauder night repair concentrate and 3) finally finish off with a generous layer of Hada Labo Tokyo skin plumping gel cream (this is a very popular line from Japan for its hydrating power due to effective Hyaluronic Acid content). Since the Olay Total Effect Moisturizer claims to deliver the 7 anti-aging effects in ONE product, I have religiously stuck with this half face trial for 20 days to give it the ultimate test. I must say from the first morning off, I was pretty amazed that both sides of the face looked and felt pretty much the same. And this condition has lasted through all three weeks. I honestly cannot say the right side of my face where I have used 3 much more expensive products looks better than the other side. From a cost effectiveness' perspective, the Olay side doesn't only save 2/3 of my nightly skincare cost, it actually saves about 5-6 times of the cost because each of the 3 products in my routine is at least 2-3 times the price of Olay 7-1. On top of that, of course there's also the time-saving concern as I need to wait for one product to fully absorb before I layer on the next one. So needless to say, Olay 7-in-1 is a winner in that department as well. After the 3-week trial, I will for sure add Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Moisturizer to my regular nightly skincare routine. I will save the other pricier items (for which I still have a lot of faith) for those days when my skin needs some extra care and pampering!

("I think Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer is a really great Moisturizer and is very light weight formula and smells great, and goes on real nice and smooth, Not only did i notice a huge difference in my skin tone, but i noticed a difference in the fine lines around my eyes and and forehead! This stuff really does work well, and it only takes a little amount of moisturizer and it spreads evenly and easily around your face. Not too oily or greasy just a great texture and smell. The unique vitamins complex really does work and i did notice results quite quickly ,and you will notice your skin brighten up and look refreshed and hydrated right after you apply it. It also does not irate my eyes or skin, like some moisturizer do. I loved this product so much that when i was done with my sample size that BzzAgent had sent to me complimentary to try and review, which was a good size sample i may add and i was able to see results with it. I went and purchased a full size bottle of Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer, a couple of weeks ago so i could continue to see results from the unique vitamin complex and continue to see results in my skin tone, completion, and fine lines and my skin continues to look refreshed and younger thanks to this amazing Moisturizer and believe i will continue to see results if i continue to use this moisturizer. I highly recommend this product ladies if your looking to help fight the seven signs of aging and looking to see results quickly at affordable price , from a reliable brand this moisturizer is a product you must purchase and try for your self. I also want to add that i'm not just saying this product works because i got the sample free i actually put my money where my mouth was and went out and purchased a full size bottle of Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer for a great price and it's a great size,easily to dispense product and you really do see results fast and it's light enough on your skin that you can really use it every day.

("Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti Aging Moisturizer claims to help with 7 problems Visibly smoothes fine lines and wrinkles, evens skin tone appearance, enhances brightness, minimizes the look of pores, visibly reduces age spots,restores firmness and replenishes moisture but does it really work and do all 7 of those things and does it do them all well I was given a trial size of this moisturizer by bzzagent and Olay to try the product and review it so I decided to try it for 2 weeks and see if it really works and does all the things it claims. I started using the moisturizer every morning either after I washed my face or as soon as I got out of the shower. After about 4 days of using it every morning I noticed that my skin looked brighter, felt and looked more firm and my skin tone looked more even, and at that point I decided I was really starting to love the way this moisturizer was making my skin look and I knew I had to keep using it to see if it was going to start helping with the other 4 areas it claims to help with as well. A few days later, after about 7 days of use, I noticed that my skin looked and felt more moisturized then it used too and that the dry flakey skin I usually have around my nose, that no matter what I haven't been able to get rid, was no longer then and was actually moisturized now. After about a week and a half I noticed that my pores looked smaller and that I didn't have as many pimples as usual, which was a bonus for me because who likes to likes to have pimples, especially in their mid 20's. At this point I was in love with this moisturizer because it was doing more then I thought it would and making my skin look and feel great. I don't really have a lot of wrinkles or fine lines (I know we all like to think we have none) but I do have a few and this moisturizer helped reduce the look of them and made it so I couldn't even notice some of them anymore. I don't really have any age spots so I cant say how it works on them, but based on how it worked on all the other problems I have I have no doubt that it would work great on them as well. So does Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 anti aging moisturizer really work and work well at that I would have to say yes!

("Okay so I have been using Olay Total Effects for a few months and can really see the difference in my skin. I have almost forgotten what my skin used to look like I had more visibly obvious fine lines and my pores were definitely more obvious. I was really surprised to look back at old pictures and see that I definitely have more fine lines around my eyes my pores were definitely more obvious and my general skintone was less even. I didn't think using Olay total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging moisturizer was really that much difference than all the other facial lotions that are on the market. I am so used to seeing commercial after commercial about different creams that claim to have all these extravagant benefits but after trying them they all seem to be the same, unlike Olay. I spent quite a bit of time over the holidays with friends and relatives that I have not seen it in a while almost all of them commented not only on how healthy and generally well that I looked but also that my skin seemed flawless and rejuvenated. As always, the first question that comes up is what have you been doing eating or not eating that has changed your appearance so much, and as I told all of them my new secret Olay. I told him all about the benefits of the reducing the size of my pores, removing the small fine lines, evening out my skin tone, and generally giving my skin a youthful glow. They all know I am a Bzz agent so of course there next question is do you have any free samples as I usually do when I am part of a campaign. They were very disappointed to know that I only got one bottle of this uber's special cream. I told them from my experience that I have seen this product go on sale fairly regularly and told them I will let them know next time I see it's on sale. So in closing, I will definitely continue to use Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging moisturizer, even if it is not on sale, which says a lot about me. So thank you again Bzz agent for letting me be a part of this fabulous campaign and once again trying a new product that I possibly wouldn't have purchased otherwise and am now a big fan.

("I started using anti aging treatment since i was 30 yo to ward off wrinkles and dull skin , I've tried other products and kept on trying because I haven't found the right one yet ,i am glad i got to try Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer .It came in a nice shape plastic bottle with a pump which is good because it pumped out small amount enough to cover your face and neck, no wastage compared to those ones in a bottle and cap where you pour too much or squeeze too much in a tube , or in a jar where you scoop lots and waste some. Olay Trial bottle contains 15 ml , not sure how long will it last but definitely i will continue using it as my everyday thing because of its visible results in just 4 days . On my first try , i pressed the pump halfway and get a good amount ,enough for my face and neck , i like this best because i can control the flow and decide just in case i need more, its consistency as i feel it on my finger feels even and smooth,it has a subtle fragrance just enough to make you feel clean and fresh,which i like because i dont want anything too smelly on my face. I applied it on my face down on my neck evenly using an ample amount and the first thing i notice is it doesn't leave a greasy feeling nor looking oily after awhile unlike my other moisturizer.I observed it on my face all day and there is no signs of oiliness at all , my face looks firm and i am even blushing all day , it feels smooth and i can feel the dryness and tightness disappear , the vitamin content is really working. I cant help staring at the mirror of every shop i went through as i went shopping that day , at this early i can see my face is glowing indeed and feels soft to touch. I also applied it before bedtime it feels like you are not wearing anything on your face at all , so light and when i wake up you can still feel the smoothness and i can see my pores closed which is another thing because of my type of skin .As i washed my face in the morning i didnt get any residue at all ,my pores are tightened , i was totally amazed as i notice my white heads are gone and my pores are minimized , I can say at this early that my skin feels firm ,even and moisturize. Fine lines under my eyes are less visible. This product works so well without leaving any signs skin irritation like itchiness and redness as it doesn't contain any harsh chemicals . It met my expectations so far ,Cant wait to share this to my friends and i will also recommend this to younger group because of its vitamin b complex content as it reduces facial oil and minimize formation of acne . I will post an update soon as i cant wait to see those fine lines under my eyes and age spots to totally disappear.

('In my first review I had only been using the Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer for about two weeks and the only improvement I thought I had seen, was the skin on my face and neck felt softer. How ever, there was more of an improvement to my facial skin than I first thought there had been in this short amount of time, I just hadnt noticed it myself. It took my sister in-laws to point out to me that the dark spots that had developed on my forehead from the summer sun had also disappeared. At first I didnt believe them and I had to get up and take a good look for myself, but sure enough they were all gone! Seeing this made my sister in-laws go out and each buy a bottle of Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer the minute they left my house and they tell me their both loving it and theyre both beginning to show improvements as well. As for myself, I still really like that you only need one pump of the bottle to get just the right amount out of it, thus youre not wasting any of the product. I love how quickly it blends into my skin and Im still pleased with how fast the little scent that it does have, fades away quickly. Aside from those wonderful aspects the thing that has sold me the most about this product are that it works! The little lines that were around my eyes and mouth arent near as noticeable as they had been at the beginning of this trail and from what I can tell the longer I use it, the more improvements Im achieving. I really cant say enough about how fast it was able to transform my skin from dull, dry looking and dotted with dark spots, into skin that looks and feels softer, is smoother and brighter and just over all refreshed looking! The question is, has using Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer for four weeks turned back the hands of time ten years Well Im not so sure about ten years, but it definitely has improved my facial skins over all appearance and Im extremely happy about that. Ill definitely continue to use Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer and with any kind of luck, those hands of time will also continue to fall back. How far they will fall and how fast is anyones guess, just as long as they keep going in the right direction Ill be happy to buy more Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer. Being able to do this trial has also convinced me to give more of the Olay products a try and I cant wait to see the results I hope to also have with them. Oh and Id also like to add that Ive heard back from well over half of the women Ive spoken with about Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer. They all have reported to me that they are also loving not only using the product, but loving the results they are all starting to achieve. Id like to thank BzzAgent and the makers of Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer for giving me the opportunity to try this wonderful product and for allowing me to inform others about it. Its been a pleasure, thank You! This review was collected as part of a promotion.', {'entities': [(45, 49, 'PRODUCT')]})
("I've been using Olay Total Effects 7-in-1 anti-aging moisturizer for a month now. I apply it in the morning and at night, after I have washed my face. Total Effects is an all-in-one anti-aging facial moisturizer that enhances one's own natural beauty by giving you younger, healthier-looking skin. I struggle with rosacea, eczema and psoriasis which often gives my skin the appearance of redness, blotchiness, roughness and a bumpy and uneven texture. Not only has Total Effects improved my fine lines, wrinkles, and age spots, but it has also diminished my skin's rough texture, dryness and scaliness. Even after having used this moisturizer for a relatively short time, my skin now looks hydrated, even toned with age spots fading. I actually developed a slight pink in my cheeks as opposed to uneven red blotches. It got rid of some red, itchy patches on my chin, forehead and the sides of my nose. It handles eczema and dryness really well. My undereye area has lightened and looks less puffy. It has a rich texture that glides on and seeps in without feeling sticky or tacky. My face feels firmer and my makeup doesn't settle in lines and creases. I'm very pleased with this product and how my skin has responded to it. Olay Total Effects 7-in-1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer works with a VitaNiacin complex and has fights the 7 signs of aging. This VitaNiacin formula, with Vitamins C and E exfoliate to enhance skin's natural self-renewal process for healthier looking skin in just 4 weeks. Although I have only used the moisturizer, Olay does have a complete line of anti-aging products to help you look anything but your age. In a nutshell, this is what Olay Total Effects can do for your skin: hydrate and diminish the appearance of fine lines, large pores, uneven texture, dryness, free radical damage, dullness and dark spots. Olay has a simple yet smart approach to achieve younger, healthier-looking skin they combine 7 benefits into 1 simple step to help keep skin look its youthful radiant best. Olay Total Effects 7-in-1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer promises to: 1. Visibly smoothes fine lines and wrinkles 2. Even skin tone appearance 3. Enhance brightness 4. Minimize the look of pores 5. Visibly reduce age spots 6. Restore firmness 7. Replenishe moisture In terms of how Olay Total Effects looks, smells and feels, this is what I found. It has a light floral scent that is pleasant yet subtle it has a soft, smooth, and non-oily/non-greasy feel that quickly and easily absorbs in the skin making skin feel super-moisturized right away it looks matte on skin when applied and makes skin look nourished and soft to the touch. Most importantly, Olay will not clog your pores. I'm very pleased with the results I've gotten from this moisturizer. I had previously been using an other anti-aging products with little or no visible improvement to my complexion. I was disheartened by spending money on beauty products and after months seeing MINIMAL results. Thankfully, I received a sample of Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer from BzzAgent to try and review. This is the best all-around anti-aging moisturizer I've ever used, truly targeting 7 skin aging problems. I recommend this product to anyone without reservation. Whatever aging signs you see in the mirror, Total Effects has a solution for all your skin's imperfections. THE OLAY PROMISE: Younger, healthier-looking skin that stands the test of time.

("There is nothing more exciting than opening up your mailbox to find you have a new BzzAgent box with a product to sample and review. The Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer arrived and certainly got me excited to try it! I was so excited to try it (and test it on my skin type) that I sampled a bit on the back of my hand first. Now, I will admit (Sigh) I'm gently approaching 40 and my hands are now less than perfect. I just had to give the cream a try somewhere, and my hands were just right there screaming out...help me! I was so impressed with just one application on my hand in comparison to my other hand I was almost tempted to do a trial on just my hand to show the difference! (But then I though...eeke....one hand would look soooo good and the other would still look so, well, spotted and older, best wait till I purchase a full size to correct that later on) I did use the sample size on my face and within a few days noticed my face seemed to be glowing, almost brighter. The texture of the cream is so smooth and goes on like velvet and has a pleasant light scent to it. With combination skin, this cream worked well for me as it didn't over do my oily areas or leave my dry areas in need. I can't say for sure in a week that my pores are any smaller, I will be able to tell more by following through with the purchase of a full size bottle. I can say that it was helping with the age spots on my hands (I know, I know...I'm reporting on my face...but whatever leftover cream I had I used from applying on my face I rubbed all over the back of my hands....let me tell you how fantastic it was to see a reduction on those ugly little spots! Whatever works right) My skin is feeling fresh and great with using the Olay total Effects 7 in 1 and I do recommend giving it a try if you are looking for a new face cream full of vitamins to help you fend off aging and age spots as well as uneven skin. Going towards 40 will be a breeze now! This review was collected as part of a promotion.", {'entities': [(137, 141, 'PRODUCT')]})

However I enjoyed texture the smell the feel of this product on my skin, how well it absorbed into my skin how it didn't leave it feeling oily or greasy, there was absolutely no residue. I had no negative reactions to this product whatsoever. I do like the Olay brand and products. I have use them for quite a few years already, I have never tried this particular line of products from Olay. So I decided to re-purchase on my own and continue using it, I am very impressed with the results I've seen from this product I do feel that my skin has firmed up, I do feel that it looks rejuvenated and healthy, as far as the fine lines and wrinkles I'm kind of thinking that they are perhaps fading a little bit . I do feel that this product is making a difference towards the luck and health of my overall skin, I will continue to use it. I like the packaging, I think it's sleek and easy to use it's nice looking, I also like the fact that this product comes in with sun protection and it also comes in scent free formula those people who do not like scented products. Olay products are very readily available, they are reasonably priced compared to some of the other antiaging products out there, I would highly recommend this product line to anybody who is looking for a good affordable high-quality readily available antiaging product.

I blessed to not have super oily, or spotty skin, but in the winter I often get very flaky skin on my face.

("I see what Warner Brothers Animation is attempting to do here and I can dig it. After finding great success with The LEGO Movie and the fact they acquired the likes of Phil Lord and Chris Miller who directed 21 and 22 Jump Street (as well as Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs, to their credit) to helm that hit animated movie the thought of continuing to try their hand at bringing in R-rated comedy directors and seeing how they operate within the world of children’s entertainment is a ballsy, but interesting move. Much like with the case of The LEGO Movie Warner Bros. was likely hoping this formula might produce something both mature and goofy with the plus of remaining consistently funny throughout the majority of its runtime. It makes sense and what better way to test said formula than with the likes of Nicolas Stoller, director of such films as Forgetting Sarah Marshall and the two Neighbors movies, thus the reason we now have Storks. Because of this inclination to take someone known for one thing and put them just far enough outside of their element, their comfort zone if you will, I was inclined to be more interested in this seemingly agreeable animated family movie than I might have been otherwise. I love it when directors or studios cast an actor known for one type or style of work, especially comedians, and place them in a different setting where we see them challenged in new/different ways that usually result in a more fascinating piece of work by virtue of the outside influences and persona that performer brings with them. That is kind of what is happening here though maybe not to the extreme of, say, Jim Carrey in The Truman Show. Rather, Stoller is being challenged by the limits of a PG-rating and how far he can go with his comedy inadvertently forcing him to be more creative with how he comes up with the laughs needed for a 90-minute children's film. And so, how does all of this hype and build-up effect the final product? Well, in many ways this is a disappointment when considering the potential the film had considering the interesting premise, its insanely talented and funny voice cast, and of course the presence of Stoller in the director's chair. Instead of producing anything unique or of distinguishable value Storks more or less plays by the rules of Pixar and DreamWorks movies where the narrative sees a couple of characters going on a quest to achieve a goal that will allow them to discover new things about themselves along the way. There's nothing especially wrong with this structure especially when executed in fun and interesting ways and Storks certainly has its quirks, but more than anything the film feels far too routine to be a product of someone who should have really been challenging themselves.", {'entities': [(560, 572, 'PRODUCT')]})

Compared to the other RevitaLift products, this one has the strongest perfume smell that does not seem necessary for a skin care product. Despite the perfume, the moisturizer did not cause any irritation or redness to my sensitive skin. The red glass jar gave the product an expensive feel and was easy to use to apply the product. After two weeks, I do feel like my skin is well moisturized and I may be imagining it, but the faint lines in my forehead seem less noticeable.

("Note: I've only used this product for two weeks, so there's a chance that continued usage would produce different results. The L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Triple Power Deep-Acting Facial Moisturizer does an excellent job of adding long-lasting moisture to my skin - but I learned that a little of this product goes a *long* way. I honestly couldn't imagine using this as anything other than a night cream, as the formula is too heavy for my skin (sensitive/dry in the cooler months, sensitive/slightly oily during warmer months). When I began using the product, I applied too much on the first two days of usage - and noticed a slight outbreak of small pimples on areas of my skin which are naturally oilier than the rest. The outbreaks cleared, however, once I adjusted the amount of product I applied. Because such a small amount is needed for full facial coverage, I can see this product lasting a very long time. While its formula is rich, it still absorbed rather quickly (although I had to do a fair bit of massaging into my skin) and only left a slightly dewy appearance on my skin. The serum is lightly scented with a fragrance which is unlikely to be offensive to most users (it reminded me of a non-powdery/floral shampoo), and its scent quickly evaporated. The scent was almost identical to other products within the RevitaLift line. Its light scent was helpful considering that I only used this product before going to bed, and dislike having heavy fragrances lingering on my skin at that point. After several days of usage, I noticed that my skin was softer than usual upon awakening, and that problem spots for dryness (such as the area around my lips) were still somewhat moisturized after 8-10 hours. Given that I've experienced no adverse effects from using the moisturizer, I'm looking forward to finishing my current jar - and then re-evaluating my skin to see if enough improvements have occurred to warrant a new purchase. I can definitely see my using this as a winter night cream - especially on my dcolletage. This review was collected as part of a promotion.", {'entities': [(127, 140, 'PRODUCT')]})

("L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Triple Power Deep-Acting Facial Moisturizer made my skin smooth and soft. I did notice however that it only temporarily plumped wrinkles but soon they reappeared. I don't have many wrinkles however so this wasn't too much of a bother. It comes in a jar which is probably why this occurred as beneficial ingredients diminish once the jar is open. It feels luxurious on the skin and has a wonderful smell but again fragrance ingredients are known to cause irritation and the preservative methylisothiazolinone. It visibly brightened and smoothed my skin however it felt pretty heavy on my skin and left it somewhat shiny. It is best used lightly. It is great for all to use except for those with allergies to to fragrance or if you are looking to control sagging of the skin or lifting of contours. It is a nice skin moisturizer but it wan't much different from other moisturizers I've used in the past except for the wonderful smell.

("Note: I've only used this product for two weeks, so there's a chance that continued usage would produce different results. The L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Triple Power Deep-Acting Facial Moisturizer does an excellent job of adding long-lasting moisture to my skin - but I learned that a little of this product goes a *long* way. I honestly couldn't imagine using this as anything other than a night cream, as the formula is too heavy for my skin (sensitive/dry in the cooler months, sensitive/slightly oily during warmer months). When I began using the product, I applied too much on the first two days of usage - and noticed a slight outbreak of small pimples on areas of my skin which are naturally oilier than the rest. The outbreaks cleared, however, once I adjusted the amount of product I applied. Because such a small amount is needed for full facial coverage, I can see this product lasting a very long time. While its formula is rich, it still absorbed rather quickly (although I had to do a fair bit of massaging into my skin) and only left a slightly dewy appearance on my skin. The serum is lightly scented with a fragrance which is unlikely to be offensive to most users (it reminded me of a non-powdery/floral shampoo), and its scent quickly evaporated. The scent was almost identical to other products within the RevitaLift line. Its light scent was helpful considering that I only used this product before going to bed, and dislike having heavy fragrances lingering on my skin at that point. After several days of usage, I noticed that my skin was softer than usual upon awakening, and that problem spots for dryness (such as the area around my lips) were still somewhat moisturized after 8-10 hours. Given that I've experienced no adverse effects from using the moisturizer, I'm looking forward to finishing my current jar - and then re-evaluating my skin to see if enough improvements have occurred to warrant a new purchase. I can definitely see my using this as a winter night cream - especially on my dcolletage. This review was collected as part of a promotion.", {'entities': [(127, 140, 'PRODUCT')]})
("So far I think that I have a favorable opinion of the L'Oreal Revitalift products. But I honestly don't think I've had enough time to try then talk. Things I like about the product Containers are easy to use, not messy. Products have a lovely scent. All three products: L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Triple Power Deep-Acting Facial Moisturizer (1.7 oz) L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Triple Power Concentrated Facial Serum Treatment (1.0 oz) L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Triple Power Facial Day Lotion SPF 20 (1.7 oz) have a beautiful feel when applying. I really like that there is no residual and/or oily feeling. The only negative (not even sure it's a negative because I'm not sure if it's because I've only had a short period of time to try) I have is that after applying my skin seems to be peeling a bit. I'm not sure if this is because it is exfoliating the dead skin or an adverse reaction to the products. It has no other side affects, so I've continued to use. So far I haven't seen a reduction in wrinkles. I do feel that my skin feels and looks smoother. This review was collected as part of a promotion.", {'entities': [(270, 283, 'PRODUCT')]})
("I think that L'Oreal Paris's RevitaLift Triple Power Deep-Acting Facial Moisturizer is super thick! I mean it totally moisturizes. I felt like it worked in to my skin easily. But I only felt comfortable putting this on at night because it is a thicker cream. After one application of rubbing it in all over my face and neck as prescribed, I woke up the next morning with quite a few zits along my jaw line... where I don't normally get break outs. Now I could have just not worked it in well enough... But I am leary since I don't want to have to worry about acne. So I will have to keep testing.

("Though this cream isn't marketed for night-time use, I found that the evening is the best time for me to apply it. Because it is thick and rich, it is too heavy for day use on my combination skin.

("At 30 years old, I'm trying to care for my skin well but the combination of oily and dry makes it a bit of a challenge. L'Oreal Paris' RevitaLift Triple Power Deep-Acting Facial Moisturizer is truly deep acting and moisturizing. It goes on smoothly without being too heavy, goopy, or sticky. After use, my winter-worn skin was tighter, smoother, and brighter- it just seemed happier and clearly better cared for. Because of my combination skin, I realized daily use was too much for me so I cut down to a couple times a week all over and daily use just on drier parts of my skin. I recommend this to everyone for occasional use, but definitely for those who have drier skin and need the deep moisturizing. I even use it on my hands! After a day of baking and frequent hand washing and outdoor work in cold weather, my hands were chapped, dry, and worn, I used the facial moisturizer on them before bed and, in addition to instantly feeling better, they were soft and rejuvenated in the morning.

What this does tell me is that this might be a perfect match for those who struggle with extremely dry skin! I have noticed some difference in my complexion over the two weeks - most noticeably that my previously dry skin is now well moisturized - even over moisturized. I love the scent of this product - it is light and fresh. The packaging is beautiful and luxe, however it is simply a jar, not a pump, so if you are concerned about bacteria you may want to use a spatula or spoon with this product.

This product is extremely hydrating! I feel like my face was moisturized all day!

("First off, I'm loving how professional and up-scale the container for this moisturizer looks on my white quarts bathroom countertops! The dark red really stands out, and its one of the few things I'm OK with leaving out as opposed to hiding in a drawer of cabinet! Though the look of the container is nice, a twist off top for moisturizer isn't ideal to me - I use this in the mornings when getting ready for work, so I want to be able to quickly pump some product onto my fingers without having to worry about re-twisting back on a top or getting the container covered in product. So that's one disappointment I have about the moisturizer. I'm also disappointed with the quantity in the container - for something that should be used daily, I'd expect more so that it would last longer. I've been using the L'Oreal Paris Deep-Acting Facial Moisturizer for a few days now, mostly in the mornings after showering and washing my face. The texture is thick and feels soothing on my skin, though it does feel a little heavy if I accidentally use to much. I've learned that a little goes a long way, so be aware of this! My favorite aspect of this moisturizer is how long it lasts. I'm experimenting with using less foundation and BB cream and have found that even without these, if I use this moisturizer, in the afternoons my face still feels soft and protected (I find that I'm actually washing this product off my face in the evenings - it didn't necessarily rub off throughout the day). I have not noticed any particular change in how my skin looks (wrinkle lift, firming, etc.), except for the fact that my face looks noticeably moisturized and healthy (which is great, since that is clearly stated on the box as an outcome after one week of use and I've only been using this for maybe 5 days). Like many products, this is one that will take about 4 weeks to notice any difference in skin appearance, so don't be alarmed if you don't have any results right away. Overall, I'm happy with the texture and smoothness of the moisturizer and would definitely suggest it over the standard daily moisturizers - those then to dry up within a few hours. I'd gladly put this on every day and have a glowing smooth look, rather than covering up with foundation and BB creams! I just happen to prefer using this in the mornings rather than the evenings, so the twist off container is annoying to me when I'm trying to quickly get ready in the morning, but if you use it in the evenings or aren't in a hurry, then maybe it won't be a big deal to you.

("I normally do not use nighttime moisturizers, but decided to try out the L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Triple Power Deep-Acting Facial Moisturizer. It has a thick and creamy consistency but spread on my face easily and did not feel greasy. A little goes a long way so don't use too much! I was not a fan of the fragrance. I personally like creams on my face that have no powerful smell, because it bothers me and keeps me awake since I keep smelling it. I woke up to a fresh-feeling face. The cream did not stain my pillow and by morning I no longer could smell the fragrance. My skin was soft, smooth and hydrated. I am very happy with this moisturizer with the exception of the fragrance. This review was collected as part of a promotion.", {'entities': [(73, 86, 'PRODUCT')]})

("I've been using L'Oreal Paris Revitalift Triple Power Deep-Acting Facial Moisturizer every night for the last two weeks. At first I was using it along with the Revitalift serum, but I found that this combination was just too rich for my face and I was waking up with an oily complexion, so I switched to using the moisturizer on its own and have had much better results. What this does tell me is that this might be a perfect match for those who struggle with extremely dry skin! I have noticed some difference in my complexion over the two weeks - most noticeably that my previously dry skin is now well moisturized - even over moisturized. I love the scent of this product - it is light and fresh. The packaging is beautiful and luxe, however it is simply a jar, not a pump, so if you are concerned about bacteria you may want to use a spatula or spoon with this product. I removed 1 star for this. A little goes a long way and with once a day use I anticipate this 1.7 oz jar lasting me 3-4 months - a great value for the price!

("I mistakenly previously reviewed this product and was thinking it was the serum...so this is correct review. Sorry.

It is easy to use and it is a cream. I liked the idea that it was helping my skin and contains Pro-Xylane which stimulates collagen production. I would apply it to my face and also my neck. But it leaves a coated feeling which I did not like. It doesn't seem to be absorbed into the skin completely like the serum. So now I just apply it in the evening only. Still love that it is working on my skin. I find it my job to keep my skin young looking and this makes my job so much easier...I would recommend it, but only for night time use.

("L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Triple Power Deep-Acting Facial Moisturizer is a god-send! I LOVE this moisturizer! I have used it for the past 3 weeks every night as my last facial product. I am a 3xs a week Retin-A user (for anti-aging) and my skin really needs a lot of moisture to balance out the drying effects of Retin-A. I like to use products that are a little heavier at night because my skin soaks them up throughout the night pretty well. Sometimes I feel like I need to use a moisturizer first thing in the morning as well because my skin usually feels pretty dry. I used L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Triple Power Deep-Acting Facial Moisturizer on my face, neck and decollete. Sometimes I would treat my hands too. When using L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Triple Power Deep-Acting Facial Moisturizer at night, my skin was surprisigly still pretty fabulously moisturized in the morning (versus other products I have tried). It is easily absorbed by my face without leaving any greasy traces. I love the light, fresh, floral scent too. The added bonus is the anti-aging ingredients that are added to this moisturizer: Pro-Xylane and Hyaluronic Acid. Together, these ingredients help my skin to be more radiant in the morning and nice and soft- a big win win in my book, especially since I am combatting dry Retin-A skin all the time! I felt like my skin looked more rested and therefore, more youthful. I did not use this moisturizer in my morning routine, but after these great nighttime results, I am going to try it out. The only thing I would change would be the packaging. The jar is beautiful, however, I would really like it to come with a pump so the active ingredients are not exposed to the air and the amount used could be more controlled. Lastly, I would definitely recommend L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Triple Power Deep-Acting Facial Moisturizer to a friend and will most definitely be using it on myself in the future!

("I just started using L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Triple Power Deep-Acting Facial Moisturizer last week. I am 36, and I am just starting to see some fine lines around my eyes. I can't speak to whether it improves fine lines or wrinkles yet, because I have only been using it for about a week now. But I'll tell you about what I've noticed about the product so far. Pros: -It goes on light and absorbs well into my skin. I hate heavy, greasy products. This is not greasy or thick. -It has added SPF 30 sunscreen. This is SO important in a daily moisturizer, and definitely will help prevent wrinkles. -I had some acne spots on my face when I started using this product. I did not have any additional breakouts as a result of using this product. -Although the 1.7 oz bottle seems small, you only need a very small amount to cover your whole face. I think this one bottle would last me a couple months. -The packaging is very cute! I love the deep red and purple colors. Cons: -The L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Triple Power system involves using at least three different products. It can be expensive to buy all three products, and it's a bit of a hassle to use all three over the course of a day. If you like using multiple products, it's not a big deal, but for me, I think I'd prefer a more simple routine. -It is a scented product, which may not be appropriate for sensitive skin. The scent is nice, though--a light, clean scent, and it is less overpowering than some other products I have tried. Overall: I liked this product a lot. I think it worked well for my skin, and I would recommend it to others. This review was collected as part of a promotion.", {'entities': [(21, 34, 'PRODUCT')]})

In the past, my skin has become greasy and has even broken out when using a thicker cream. Not so this time! It is quickly absorbed but not in a way that I feel like I need more on right away.

("The weather is getting chilly, so the air is getting dry which is why I appreciate a great moisturizer I can wear overnight and wake up to soft supple skin. L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift moisturizer is a really fabulous night cream. It's thick but not too thick, creamy and when applied it sinks in nicely with leaving a sticky filmy feeling behind. It's lightly scented, so if you are sensitive to fragrance, you may want to keep that in mind, but it's definitely not overwhelming, and fades quickly. I do use this in conjunction with the serum from the same line, and they work really well together. A multi-step skin regimen is something I have taken on to start taking care of my skin before it shows any signs of aging. This is formulated to treat deep wrinkles, but I'm in my late 20's so I don't really have those signs of aging, but I do think there a value in using this product before you truly need it. The price is right and it's readily available so there is no downside. I would stick to keeping this as a night cream because without sunscreen you are missing a key component in skin care. Overall my impression after using it for a few weeks, is it's great moisturizer that will having you wake up with soft skin if you use it consistently. Overall, great buy.

("L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Triple Power Deep-Acting Facial Moisturizer (1.7 oz) works very well! Right away when you open the lotion and dip your finger in the well the product feels very rich and thick, not watered down or thin to the touch. This product does have a slight fragrance but I love it. If you do not like any type of fragrance in your skin lotion, this product may not be for you. I have only been using this product for a short time now and I definitely feel the results in my skin already by repairing wrinkles, re-firming your skin and redensifiying. The elasticity in my skin does feel better after using this product.

You don't need a lot of lotion, it goes a long way. I like to rub any lotion left on my hands on them. they feel soft and smoother. My Halloween makeup looked flawless when I used underneath. I looked and felt younger also. My mother noticed a nice change in my complexion. I would recommend buying this product even though its higher than I would normally pay for price wise.

Obviously at 75 I am going to have some issues with my skin, personally I think that I have pretty good skin for my age but this cream really did tighten my face up really well and I think that my wrinkles and fine lines look so much better!

I don't need to reapply an hour or two later. My skin feels and looks smoother already! The scent is light and fresh also, that is a huge plus! I have already recommended this product to a friend of mine dealing with dry skin due to the cooler weather. The price is a little higher than other facial moisturizers, but you are getting what you pay for. A little of this stuff goes a LONG WAY! It's worth every penny!

I have fairly dry skin that is also sensitive to harsh products so I am always a little nervous to try something new. The L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Triple Power Deep-Acting Facial Moisturizer has a smooth, light application that doesn't irritate my eyes like other potent moisturizers. It does take a while to fully absorb into the skin, which is recommended on the bottle, so I waited before adding anything else to my face. I applied it in the morning and in the evening after cleaning my face. My face feels hydrated and silky smooth. My hands even seem to benefit from it as well! While both products state that they fight wrinkles, I can't say that I have seen a different in the wrinkle department yet, although, I only have two forehead wrinkles to monitor.

It's not too heavy of a cream, which is important to me. It doesn't leave my skin feeling greasy at all like some products. Which is also important to me since I'm prone to breakouts. It's very moisturizing and my skin looks very healthy since adding this to my routine. I'm very excited about using this with winter coming up, I get dry patches in areas of my face and I think this will end that. My skin looks more youthful and fine lines are less noticeable.

("I just started using L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Triple Power Deep-Acting Facial Moisturizer last week. I am 36, and I am just starting to see some fine lines around my eyes. I can't speak to whether it improves fine lines or wrinkles yet, because I have only been using it for about a week now. But I'll tell you about what I've noticed about the product so far. Pros: -It goes on light and absorbs well into my skin. I hate heavy, greasy products. This is not greasy or thick. -It has added SPF 30 sunscreen. This is SO important in a daily moisturizer, and definitely will help prevent wrinkles. -I had some acne spots on my face when I started using this product. I did not have any additional breakouts as a result of using this product. -Although the 1.7 oz bottle seems small, you only need a very small amount to cover your whole face. I think this one bottle would last me a couple months. -The packaging is very cute! I love the deep red and purple colors. Cons: -The L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Triple Power system involves using at least three different products. It can be expensive to buy all three products, and it's a bit of a hassle to use all three over the course of a day. If you like using multiple products, it's not a big deal, but for me, I think I'd prefer a more simple routine. -It is a scented product, which may not be appropriate for sensitive skin. The scent is nice, though--a light, clean scent, and it is less overpowering than some other products I have tried. Overall: I liked this product a lot.

I put it on after I wash my wash then I have my breakfast. I then put my makeup on and go to work. It can also act like a makeup base because it makes my foundation go on smoother and my skin looks very polished and professional. I don't think I'll use anything else.

("I absolutely love the L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Triple Power Deep-Acting Facial Moisturizer! It's worked wonders for me, especially combined with the serum. I use this at night after I wash my face. I wake up with soft and glowing skin. I've searched high and low for the perfect night cream/moisturizer with the benefits I need and so far, this it it. It's not too heavy of a cream, which is important to me. It doesn't leave my skin feeling greasy at all like some products. Which is also important to me since I'm prone to breakouts. It's very moisturizing and my skin looks very healthy since adding this to my routine. I'm very excited about using this with winter coming up, I get dry patches in areas of my face and I think this will end that. My skin looks more youthful and fine lines are less noticeable. My eyes, my forehead, and around my mouth look much better, you can really tell a difference. I highly recommend adding this to your routine. You can probably do away with a lot of other products you use to achieve the same result with just this and tell serum!

("I think that the L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Triple Power Deep-Acting Facial Moisturizer is AMAZING! I have been using it at bedtime for about 2 weeks and I love it. I'm prone to dry spots on my face. Since using this moisturizer, I haven't battled those dry spots! I was a bit skeptical at first because it is a heavier moisturizer. In the past, my skin has become greasy and has even broken out when using a thicker cream. Not so this time! It is quickly absorbed but not in a way that I feel like I need more on right away. It also has a pleasant scent that is not overpowering. As for the product's claim to diminish dark spots, I haven't noticed a difference yet. But, I do love the texture of my skin after starting to use this product! This review was collected as part of a promotion.", {'entities': [(17, 30, 'PRODUCT')]})

Obviously at 75 I am going to have some issues with my skin, personally I think that I have pretty good skin for my age but this cream really did tighten my face up really well and I think that my wrinkles and fine lines look so much better! I love every single one of the products that I was sent but this one is definitely my favorite and I would recommend this for anyone who is looking for some tightening and filling on the skin with lots of moisture! This for sure compares to my high end products. This review was collected as part of a promotion.", {'entities': [(5, 18, 'PRODUCT')]})
("L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Triple Power Deep-Acting Facial Moisturizer is a god-send! I LOVE this moisturizer! I have used it for the past 3 weeks every night as my last facial product. I am a 3xs a week Retin-A user (for anti-aging) and my skin really needs a lot of moisture to balance out the drying effects of Retin-A. I like to use products that are a little heavier at night because my skin soaks them up throughout the night pretty well. Sometimes I feel like I need to use a moisturizer first thing in the morning as well because my skin usually feels pretty dry. I used L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Triple Power Deep-Acting Facial Moisturizer on my face, neck and decollete. Sometimes I would treat my hands too. When using L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Triple Power Deep-Acting Facial Moisturizer at night, my skin was surprisigly still pretty fabulously moisturized in the morning (versus other products I have tried). It is easily absorbed by my face without leaving any greasy traces. I love the light, fresh, floral scent too. The added bonus is the anti-aging ingredients that are added to this moisturizer: Pro-Xylane and Hyaluronic Acid. Together, these ingredients help my skin to be more radiant in the morning and nice and soft- a big win win in my book, especially since I am combatting dry Retin-A skin all the time! I felt like my skin looked more rested and therefore, more youthful. I did not use this moisturizer in my morning routine, but after these great nighttime results, I am going to try it out. The only thing I would change would be the packaging. The jar is beautiful, however, I would really like it to come with a pump so the active ingredients are not exposed to the air and the amount used could be more controlled. Lastly, I would definitely recommend L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Triple Power Deep-Acting Facial Moisturizer to a friend and will most definitely be using it on myself in the future!

I have already recommended this product to a friend of mine dealing with dry skin due to the cooler weather.

Although the moisturizer has a thick and creamy texture, it is very light after applying to the face. And also the fact that a little dab goes a long way, is a MAJOR plus for me!

("The sony extra bass XB70BT is a around the neck wireless headset that offers sound pushing bass with HD voice quality for cell phone talk. Right out of the box one of the first noticeable thing was the quality of the band. The band that rest around your neck appears to be a flexible silicon base product. While this may seem ideal in the way of sturdiness this tends to be a nuisance for those seeking to do heavy workouts or running. The band has no rigidity so you are able to twist it and even lay it flat on the table in a straight line. Paring the device is easy and just takes a matter of seconds all you need is a device which offers Bluetooth, which basically covers almost any current product made now. I decided to take this product to the gym to see how the head set would hold up in some high intensity workouts. One of the first things i noticed was it did not rest around my neck in a position that allowed me to tuck it away under my collar line. In fact in my opinion it looked awkward and could not be easily displaced. As i began running i noticed the headset started to shift down to my left side making it even more awkward around my neck, i assume this was due to the fact that this side probably carried more weight and without the rigidity of a normal neckband there was really nothing there to stop if from sliding. Sony provides a clip that allows you to hold your earbud wires together and adjust there position but this did not help the situation too much as far as movement was concerned. As i began to sweat more i noticed the neck band became more unstable around my neck and slid around alot more easily. I did notice the earbuds did fit firmly in my ear canal and never once did i feel they were about to fall out. The ear buds come with three different sizes to fit all needs so you shouldn't have a problem fitting them. Aside from the awkward band lets talk about sound quality, after all that's what Sony is really known for. The sound quality was awesome. I am a big fan of products that can really push the bass out without taking away from vocals and my highs or mids. One of the biggest problems i have found with wireless headsets is there ability to put out some heavy hitting bass. Now while the more expensive over the ear style will do a better job, these headsets are definitely no push over. The sound quality significantly made up for the poor design. And while i wish the battery life would of been longer, 9 hours of battery life is more then adequate to enjoy some of the superb sound quality your songs will have to offer. At the end of the day this is a good headset for the price and the main reason for 3 stars is the weird silicon design for the band. The Good:-Awesome sound quality with superb bass that does not take away from the rest of the sound quality-9 hour battery life-HD sound and voice for cell phone talk-Affordable priceThe Bad:-Awkward band that at times does not feel secure", {'entities': [(1341, 1345, 'PRODUCT')]})

Call quality is excellent, for both me and the person on the other end of the call. The floppy neck strap is far superior to stiff models, and feels like it will take a fair amount of punishment. The only issue I've run into, which is not much of an issue, is the volume controls on the headphones and the volume controls on my android phone are independent of each other. So when I first turned them on and turned up the volume from my phone, the volume on the headphones was still very quiet. Once I figured out that the headphone volume controls operate independently of the phone controls, I was able to crank the volume up. Now I just leave the headphones turned all the way up and control the volume with my phone.Overall I would highly recommend these great Sony headphones.", {'entities': [(42, 46, 'PRODUCT')]})

Also the wires are a little long and can sometimes get in the way. Probably not good for running or using at the gym, get the sport headphones for that. Otherwise, good sound and lots of bass.

("First, I have to say that I was skeptical of the 'extra bass' claim for these in-ear headphones. After taking these headphones for a 'test drive' as it may be, I can tell you that you will find yourself wondering why your body isn't vibrating due to the extremely low and high quality bass sounds. I have a very high end home theater system from Best Buy's Magnolia store that will rattle paintings off the wall and these headphones produce the same sound, except in your ear--that's pretty hard to do. I have Bose over the ear headphones and they are only slightly better as far as clarity, but the Sony XB70BT blow right past the Bose for lower sounds. I don't want anyone to get the wrong impression that you'll lose your hearing after using these, that's not the case at all. They produce high definition bass at normal listening volume as well as cranked up. That's exactly what you want. Now for the critical part of my review. I find the design to be awkward. The rubber neck strap that keeps the headphones hanging on (but detached from your phone) doesn't feel natural to use to either raise or lower the volume. They are still new to me so I'm sure I'll get used to it, but I also found it hard to tell which buttons I was pushing. In addition, the wires that extend from the rubber band and control unit are a little too long. They sometimes got caught in my coat or even in a stray arm movement. Now, they have to be long enough to fit everyone, but I would've appreciated a way to adjust the wires to fit your individual needs. I think this is one way the over the hear wireless headphones may be superior in that everything is on your head and there are no wires to mess with. All of that being said, I'm glad to have these headphones. They were easy to travel with and I'm sure when I'm not taking a winter coat on and off in the airport it will be fine. Also, they were very easy to wad up and stuff in my laptop bag when not in use. The build felt solid enough that I wasn't worried about anything being crushed or broken. In fact, they got tangled and crammed pretty good and still look brand new so I'd say they'll hold up to those who are hard on their toys like I am.", {'entities': [(600, 604, 'PRODUCT')]})

('ProsJust as comfortable as a necklace with flexible band around neckMultiple earpiecesEarpieces stay in place well without discomfortGood battery lifeSimple voice announcements for status Universal Micro USB charging portStays in place well using cord claspMids tones are very goodNFC charging is extremely easyConsBass tones are too strongHighs tones are too weakControl buttons are poorly differentiated using touchClasp to hold around your neck could be easier to useFor years, I have stuck with traditional headphones because the wireless headphones I have seen have either had rigid parts that hang around your neck or the overall music quality just didnt justify the change. I just dealt with the cords getting tangled and regularly snagged on clothing as I moved around. About twice a year I would have to get a new set as they would usually get destroyed by those shortcomings.I finally decided to take the plunge and go wireless with the Sony XB70BT headphones and couldnt be happier. I have quickly forgotten how often my cord would get snagged or tangled and I just enjoy using them. They have a soft, flexible rubber band that goes around your neck and conforms much like a necklace except without the cold shock of metal. In fact, sometimes I have forgotten I was wearing them for a short period.If you want headphones for exercise but dont like the kind that use the extra piece to grab onto your earlobe to stay in place these might be for you. I wouldnt do gymnastics with them but they should work great for most regular exercises. To make sure they stay in place, there is a small slotted piece on the wire of one earbud that you push the other earbud wire in. This allows it to wrap around your neck and stay in place much like a tight necklace. It does a good job of staying in place but a slight redesign would be helpful as pushing a flexible wire into the tight slot can be a test in patience. Once in, it works well and keeps things secure. A small addition that would be helpful is if there was a way to store the earbuds when not in use but the headset was still around your neck. The buttons can be used without looking. It might take a little time to adjust as the tiny raised sections on each are a bit difficult to tell apart.The first time you pair the headset with your phone you will get to take advantage of an easily overlooked but extremely helpful feature. If your phone supports NFC, just tap the side of the headphones with the NFC logo. You phone will simply ask if you want to pair, you tap Yes, and you are done. No codes or any other work. Very simple. If you need to switch devices, just press and hold the power button until it says Bluetooth Pairing and tap the logo with your phone or NFC capable device you are done.Headphones that speak might sound a little strange but this one is done thoughtfully. When you turn them on, off, activate pairing, or certain other options the headphones will say in plain English what they are doing. If you are from England you would say it speaks in proper English I suppose. The voice is only used for operations where more information is helpful. Regular changes in volume and track skips are either a tone or just the action. Youll only here speech when something more than a tone is helpful. Overall, its a nice touch that just makes them feel a bit more refined.The big question is how do they sound. For speech, everyone I have spoken to has not even noticed that I am using a headset. The microphone seems to work just as well as the one built into my phone. When listening to music I wouldnt say these are top of the line but considering you can spend over $100 on corded headphones expectations must be kept in line. They sound is very good for most music. An equalizer would be great but phones dont general offer an equalizer for Bluetooth devices. Considering sound quality for music, each person of course has their own sound preferences but I would describe the sound as a slightly muddy but not unpleasant. With weak highs, the bass seems a bit too heavy. Midtones are excellent. Of course, this is all very subjective and this may suit you just perfectly. Keep in mind we are talking about compressed Bluetooth audio anyway. Dont expect to hear every nuance of your favorite classical music through this set. Hopefully my description will help you decide if the sound properties suit you.Overall I have been extremely happy with my foray into wireless headphones to the point I am not sure I will ever go back for regular use. I will probably always have a set of wired for at home when sitting still but for all other uses, the Sony XB70BT headphones do a respectable job for the money.', {'entities': [(947, 951, 'PRODUCT')]})

("Just to preface, I've never been a fan of earbuds. Primarily because they get uncomfortable for me pretty quickly.With that said, these are awesome. The remind me a lot of an older pair of Sennheiser PX-100 over the ear's I had. Those headphones were well known for their bass response. I do quite enjoy a strong bass delivery for when I'm listening to a variety of tracks and these fit the bill and then some.They are pretty darn comfortable. Prop's to Sony for providing 4 different sized ear pieces so that you get the best fit. I really like how the band comfortably drapes around your neck and just doesn't get in the way. I don't how feasible they would be for heavy exercising, jogging or running but I imagine if you tuck them under a collar you might be ok.Audio wise these things really are fantastic. They are a good alternative to bring with me out and about as an alternative to my QC35's. The bass response is incredible, they pack a lot of punch especially on bass heavy tracks. Something I've always been skeptical of with ear buds. I will say technology has come a very long ways in terms of ear buds being able to be viable over the ear replacements. Even though the Low End is really punchy, it doesn't detract a lot from the other ranges. These are pretty much aimed at those who enjoy a lot of low range in their music since that's where they are strongest. If you want something portable, and for around $100 or less with brand quality, I'd say very much look at this as they will fit the bill and then some.I can't speak too much on the battery life only cause I haven't run them out yet. Charged them the day I got them and have used them on and off for about 3 or so weeks now off a single charge, so ymmv.They don't come with a carrying case or anything sadly but they are easy enough to put away in a pocket or even just keep them hanging around your neck.Overall, I would definitely recommend these to anyone looking for bass heavy response headphones.

Pairing was super easy as these go into discovery mode on the first power-on so you just search for bluetooth on your device and they pop up right away. The flexible band is comfortable, and reversible. I find that I prefer having the buttons facing outward instead of inward. Probably not going to use the widget for clipping the wires together except for when I need to put these into a bag for travel.

('ProsJust as comfortable as a necklace with flexible band around neckMultiple earpiecesEarpieces stay in place well without discomfortGood battery lifeSimple voice announcements for status Universal Micro USB charging portStays in place well using cord claspMids tones are very goodNFC charging is extremely easyConsBass tones are too strongHighs tones are too weakControl buttons are poorly differentiated using touchClasp to hold around your neck could be easier to useFor years, I have stuck with traditional headphones because the wireless headphones I have seen have either had rigid parts that hang around your neck or the overall music quality just didn’t justify the change. I just dealt with the cords getting tangled and regularly snagged on clothing as I moved around. About twice a year I would have to get a new set as they would usually get destroyed by those shortcomings.I finally decided to take the plunge and go wireless with the Sony XB70BT headphones and couldn’t be happier. I have quickly forgotten how often my cord would get snagged or tangled and I just enjoy using them. They have a soft, flexible rubber band that goes around your neck and conforms much like a necklace except without the cold shock of metal. In fact, sometimes I have forgotten I was wearing them for a short period.If you want headphones for exercise but don’t like the kind that use the extra piece to grab onto your earlobe to stay in place these might be for you. I wouldn’t do gymnastics with them but they should work great for most regular exercises. To make sure they stay in place, there is a small slotted piece on the wire of one earbud that you push the other earbud wire in. This allows it to wrap around your neck and stay in place much like a tight necklace. It does a good job of staying in place but a slight redesign would be helpful as pushing a flexible wire into the tight slot can be a test in patience. Once in, it works well and keeps things secure. A small addition that would be helpful is if there was a way to store the earbuds when not in use but the headset was still around your neck. The buttons can be used without looking. It might take a little time to adjust as the tiny raised sections on each are a bit difficult to tell apart.The first time you pair the headset with your phone you will get to take advantage of an easily overlooked but extremely helpful feature. If your phone supports NFC, just tap the side of the headphones with the NFC logo. You phone will simply ask if you want to pair, you tap Yes, and you are done. No codes or any other work. Very simple. If you need to switch devices, just press and hold the power button until it says “Bluetooth Pairing” and tap the logo with your phone or NFC capable device you are done.Headphones that speak might sound a little strange but this one is done thoughtfully. When you turn them on, off, activate pairing, or certain other options the headphones will say in plain English what they are doing. If you are from England you would say it speaks in “proper English” I suppose. The voice is only used for operations where more information is helpful. Regular changes in volume and track skips are either a tone or just the action. You’ll only here speech when something more than a tone is helpful. Overall, it’s a nice touch that just makes them feel a bit more refined.The big question is how do they sound. For speech, everyone I have spoken to has not even noticed that I am using a headset. The microphone seems to work just as well as the one built into my phone. When listening to music I wouldn’t say these are top of the line but considering you can spend over $100 on corded headphones expectations must be kept in line. They sound is very good for most music. An equalizer would be great but phones don’t general offer an equalizer for Bluetooth devices. Considering sound quality for music, each person of course has their own sound preferences but I would describe the sound as a slightly muddy but not unpleasant. With weak highs, the bass seems a bit too heavy. Midtones are excellent. Of course, this is all very subjective and this may suit you just perfectly. Keep in mind we are talking about compressed Bluetooth audio anyway. Don’t expect to hear every nuance of your favorite classical music through this set. Hopefully my description will help you decide if the sound properties suit you.Overall I have been extremely happy with my foray into wireless headphones to the point I am not sure I will ever go back for regular use. I will probably always have a set of wired for at home when sitting still but for all other uses, the Sony XB70BT headphones do a respectable job for the money.', {'entities': [(948, 952, 'PRODUCT')]})

The color was a little dark on me and I probably won't be getting much use out of it, but I loved the product itself. It applies very evenly and easily. The color is very bold too. It wasn't insanely long lasting, but definitely worth it. It was fairly dry, but not as dry as other liners. I would recommend topping it off with NYX butter gloss or NYX Chunky Dunk. I would totally buy this product in another color.", {'entities': [(66, 69, 'PRODUCT')]})

("There is no lip pencil that can't even compare or come close to NYX. These inexpensive ones are the creamiest, go on smooth no matter what the temps are. My others used to get hard during cold weather. These stay on FOREVER, even after eating your lips still have beautiful color. Love..Love Love them. Will not use another brand again.", {'entities': [(64, 67, 'PRODUCT')]})
("NYX lip liners are the first i've ever used so I can't really compare to any other brands. The formula is smooth and very pigmented, I like to apply on my entire lip without adding lipstick on top and I get the perfect matte lip! Only downside is that its kinda hard to sharpen. Every time i try to sharpen my lip pencil the product breaks off :/ Some said to put it in the fridge so that the wax can harden before sharpening so I will give that a try! For my signature neutral pink lip, NUDE PINK is perfect!", {'entities': [(0, 3, 'PRODUCT')]})

('I recently purchased a handful of these! I have Orange, Rose, Nude Pink, Hot Red, and Hot Pink. I also received Nectar as a free gift with my last order.

("Ever since the first time I bought a NYX slim pencil in hot pink I have been hooked! I will never purchase a lipstick/lipliner from an over priced store again. I am big on bold bright lips. This pencil gives me the matte look I have always had a hard time finding anywhere else. I use it as a lipstick it is creamy enough to use on my entire lips. If I am feeling in the mood I will add a similar pink lip gloss to give my lips some shine.I've received so many compliments and would like to try EVERY single shade NYX offers. I've also used Dolly Pink which is more of a soft pink when I want to tone it done. I love that one too.", {'entities': [(37, 40, 'PRODUCT')]})

("I wanted a body scrub product that was gentler than apricot scrub so thought I'd try this. The scent is great, the body wash is very creamy and the crushed coconut shell is very fine and gentle. I was skeptical that Softsoap could make a decent body wash, but this one is pretty nice and the price is a bargain. It doesn't exfoliate too much and the emollients seem to keep your skin moist and soft.", {'entities': [(216, 224, 'PRODUCT')]})

("I have really enjoyed using Softsoap Body Scrub Coconut Butter Exfoliating Body Wash. The scent is wonderful and not overpowering. It's got a great lather, and cleans very well.

I don't feel like it exfoliates very well, but that's not something my skin needs this time of year.", {'entities': [(28, 36, 'PRODUCT')]})
