("To me this rice is so different than my regular rice (long grain brown) that I think of it as a different grain. Yes, the aroma is interesting I'd say it takes a bit of getting used to. I really enjoy the size and texture of the cooked grains. After trying the Wehani by itself, I began cooking 1/3 Wehani, 1/3 Lundberg Brown Basmati and 1/3 either brown rice store brand or Wang sweet brown rice that I get at an Asian supermarket. I always saute the rice in a bit of vegetable oil 'til it is browned, before adding the liquid. This combo and browning seems to develop the nutty flavor that I favor. However, I've found that when browning the rice, not to overdo it because if the rice gets too roasted it will no longer cook normally - apparently it loses its ability to absorb water. Then you get the crunchies.I do find that Wehani takes considerably longer to fully absorb the water. I use the regular 2:1 ratio, water to rice (plus salt). It is my practice to bring it to a rolling boil, then reduce the heat to a simmer for 2 hours. It just means planning ahead a bit further.Often I cook meat at the same time in the same pot, starting both together so the rice will gain the flavoring of the meat juices. When I do that, I adjust the other liquid downward. The one alert I'd post is that the strong coloring of the rice stains the meat, especially when using the Wehani alone. Doesn't bother me, but you might want to know this will happen.Chilled cooked Wehani rice makes a fine salad with the addition of minced garlic, fresh ginger root pared then diced, finely sliced scallions, chopped fresh parsley and Chinese five-spice.

("From all I have ever been able to learn, Lundberg is a first class operation. I have tried (I think) every rice and rice blend that they offer, over the years that I have been buying their products. While I didn't always care for a particular variety, it was never an issue of quality, just a matter of personal preference.There is one problem, which is not Lundberg's fault, but is worth noting. Too often, in local grocery stores, the Lundberg product does not turn over fast enough to avoid a decline in quality. I assume it is caused by a fermentation of the whole grain (not a problem with lesser rices because much of the good stuff is removed). The symptoms are a bag which is swollen, and rice which tastes a bit like Play-Doh smells. Play-Doh 24 Pack of Colors In order to avoid this problem, I started ordering my Lundberg on-line, and storing the extra bags in my freezer or refrigerator until used. So, buying it here (which is a little cheaper than Lundberg's on-line store) is a good way to go. If you want to buy just one bag to try at your local grocery store, check the bag carefully, and if it tastes like Play-Doh when you get home with it, that bag was too old.Of all the Lundberg products, Countrywild is my absolute favorite. It is a nice blend of flavors, and I sometimes eat a bowl of it for my entire meal. It has a good flavor to it, but it is not as intense as some of the other varieties.One more thing. For years I was frustrated with obtaining a good result when cooking whole grain rice. I finally tried a pressure rice cooker instead of the more common non-pressure methods.

When I was selected to test Olay Total Effects Anti Aging Moisturizer I was filled with great expectations, hoping that this moisturizer would be another amazing discovery. When my product sample arrived I was quite disappointed because I was sent a sample that was way too light for my skin tone. I do not know how this happened because I selected the darkest shade in the pre-selection survey.

("I was twittering with excitement to try Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer from the moment I heard about it. My skin has begun to show signs of aging and with my upcoming wedding I was trying to look and feel my very best. An age spot or two have emerged and the fine lines were beginning to deepen. These were high on the lists of this new product. My super sensitive skin was generally okay with Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer, no small feat. Each day I would wash my skin and apply the product, waiting anxiously for the promised results...and each day I was disappointed. I was hesitant to write this review as I like Olay's products and love being a BzzAgent but I do believe in honesty. I was so disappointed in this product and the lack of Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer's claims to be true that I must give it a 0 out of 5, if I could.

I like the packaging, the texture, and even the smell, but the product made my skin blotchy, and my forehead erupted in many raised pimple-like bumps! My slightly uneven skin tone looked worse than usual, but as soon as I stopped using the moisturizer, my skin went back to normal the next day. No more blotchiness, or bumpy pimply things.

("This is the first time I have been disappointed with a product that I have tested for Bzzagent, so I'm not even sure where to begin. I just cannot say that I would buy the Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer. I gave it one star to represent the first day I used this product. I was fairly happy, but as time went on, I became more and more disappointed, and eventually stopped using it. I didn't even get through the whole sample that was sent to me. Now, I guess I should describe my skin type, because maybe that is part of the reason I did not enjoy this product. I have very fair skin, and I tend to get very rosy cheeks, so I need a skin-calming moisturizer to reduce redness. I also have sensitive skin, which is dry in parts. I rarely get acne, but my skin easily becomes dry. I have some fine lines around my eyes which bother me a bit, but they aren't that bad. A bigger issue is puffiness around my eyes. The first day I tried the Olay 7 in one moisturizer, I was pleased by its consistency and the scent wasn't bad. I believe it has the classic Olay scent that I remember from my mom's Oil of Olay that she used when I was a child. If not, it is close. It absorbed really well too! My skin felt great, and not greasy at all. Unfortunately, after using the Olay 7 in 1 for three days, I noticed my rosy cheeks starting to become worse and worse. I'm not sure whether this product has sunscreen in it, and sunscreen is a huge factor in my choice of moisturizer. Whether it was from the fact that there is no sunscreen in this one, or a reaction, my cheeks kept getting redder and redder. I don't enjoy wearing a lot of make up on a daily basis, but it started getting so bad that I had to start covering it up with concealer and powder. Then I noticed my nose becoming shinier every day, so I had to wear more make up. Finally, I noticed a pimple on my nose. This was the last straw. I stopped using the moisturizer and switched back to my usual one, and in a few days these issues with my skin went away again. So, to sum up, this moisturizer did not work for me. It's definitely worth a try, but I am pretty particular about my skin because I really don't like to cover up with make up. I'd much rather have a calm, clear complexion in the first place. I would consider trying it again if in fact one with sunscreen included came on the market, but I'm not even certain if that would be enough.

("I held off on giving my review because I wanted to make sure that I gave this product a good enough chance so I could do a good review. I was excited to receive this to try out. I was very hopeful that it would do what it claimed to do. Olay is a well known brand and I was positive that it would do wonders for my skin. My skin is starting to show fine lines and my laugh lines are getting deeper. My hopes with using this product was that it would decrease the fine lines and give me a more brighter complexion while moisturizing my skin. As I get older I find that my skin is getting more dry and I was looking for something that would hydrate my skin all day. When I first got this sample I used it for 2 days before my skin broke out. I didn't think that it was the olay so I continued to use it for several more days. I suffer from nodulocystic acne so after a couple days of using olay, the flare up of my acne was not getting better so I had to discontinue using the product. I decided that I would let my face clear up before I would try a second time to see if it was in fact the olay. Going back to trying it out though, I did notice a couple things. I felt that a little did not go a long way with olay. I had to use more then I thought I should have to get coverage. I found that it was not as thick as other moisturizers that I had tried so it was alarming to me that I had to use so much. I did like the smell of it though. It has a nice pleasant smell. Getting back to my second try of the olay. My face had cleared up after about a week and a half so I decided to try olay again. Within 1 day my face broke out in the cystic acne and I was back at square one. I was very unhappy that it broke my face out with huge acne again. I had to discontinue the product.

("Having used various formulations of Olay for the past 20 years I was really excited to try this new product. I have combination skin with some dry patches, ageing skin and occasionally a dash of dehydration. To qualify my review I think I need explain how I introduce a new skin care product to my regimen. I keep everything the same except for 1 product and I use it for a minimum of 2 weeks before I keep it in my routine. Experience has shown me that I will most often either see the beginning of benefits or any complications in that time. I approached the Total Effects in the same manner - it was the only product that I changed. I wasn't really worried, as I said, Olay products were a known entity. On the first few uses I noticed similar attributes - a distinctive scent, texture and how it applied. After about 4 days I noticed a change in my skin - namely more breakouts and red splotches. Which I found odd because pimples are not a problem I usually experience. Hormones Nope. Change in activities Nope. Other life changes Nope. Skin regime Huh... So I stopped using Olay for a couple of days to see if the skin continued to get worst or resolve itself. The red splotches disappeared and the zits started to recede. After about 5 days I decided to try it again - unfortunately the red splotches returned and I had to discontinue using the product. I hesitate to condemn the product - skin is a temperamental devil and I liked many aspects of the product - it's very emollient, the scent while fairly strong is not offensive.

("upon receipt of my Olay Total Effects 7 in one package, I must say at the onset I was juxtaposed by the trial size. Not because I'm greedy, but because I immediately wondered how much to use, what is the right amount how do I employ this properly to be able to successfully report on my degree of satisfaction (or not). That aside, I enjoyed opening up the package, and always find Olay products to be sleek and silky in their packaging nature. I put a dollop on my finger and began to apply (after cleansing my face properly, of course). The texture was ...silky and smooth. It was lovely. I saw the commercial on TV which reported healthier-looking skin in 4 weeks (I think - that is what I recall). With a tester, I'm not sure I can evaluate that claim - and apologies if I got it wrong, that is what I remember from the ad. I think the claim of 7 benefits is complicated for consumers. I can't tell you what those 7 benefits are and I'm reading the packaging of the product I received right now. I think to simplify for consumers is helpful and appreciated. Finally - no SPF. that's a big one for me. of all the benefits there is no SPF protection. The packaging doesn't specifically call out (that I can see or understand) that this product is to be used as a night routine. It also doesn't suggest that an SPF is required after application. With all the fears and media reports on skin cancer this is a big one for me.

The seven benefits noted on the product packaging are: (1) visibly smooths fine lines and wrinkles, (2) evens skin tone appearance, (3) enhances brightness, (4) minimizes the look of pores, (5) visibly reduces age spots, (6) restores firmness, and (7) replenishes moisture. My fine lines are (thankfully) still at a minimum, but I didn't note any change. My skin tone is pretty even, with the exception of my rosacea, but I've been using products from Batty's Bath which have done lovely things for my skin so I don't think the Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer have really contributed anything to that in a week's time.

I had high hopes when I received the Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 anti-aging moisturizer sample, and started using it the day it arrived.

("I've been using the Olay total effects 7 in 1 anti aging moisturizer for a week now. I use it at night only because this does not have SPF contents.

I believe this comes with an SPF version, which I would consider using in the morning. After a week of use so far, I have not noticed much anti-aging effects from it yet. Don't seem to see minimizing of wrinkles or fine lines, I have very deep laugh lines which I focus anti-aging products on, but I haven't seen any improvements yet. I like the container it comes in, which is a bottle with a nozzle so the product is not exposed to air as opposed to being in a jar. The disadvantage of that though is you cannot use the last bits of the product. The moisturizing aspect of this product is good, I apply it at night and when I wake up my skin does feel softer and not dry, more importantly it does not make my skin all oily when I wake up. Some night creams that I use will make my skin very oily the next morning, but this one did not, which I really liked, and it did not cause any outbreaks.

("Olay has been a leading name in skincare for decades. While I was eager to try this product to test its benefits, the very first interaction I had with it stunned me. Upon receiving the box, I read the ingredients. This moisturizer is based entirely with alcohol. Alcohol can provide a quick drying, non-greasy finish but it also zaps your skin's natural moisture, creating the need for you to use more of the product. I decided to try and put that out of my mind and try this product anyway. It is a pleasantly not too heavy lotion that I used every day for two weeks morning and night. Indeed, the lotion sinks into skin and quickly disappears. I did not experience any residual flaking indicating that my skin was not becoming more dry after use. However, in order to maintain the moisture level regular use gave me, I simply have to keep using the product. Other products I've used tend to help my skin maintain its own moisture and I can use the products as-needed. This product requires regular use again, this is a side effect of the alcohol. While this moisturizer gave me a lovely soft feeling after use and it was not unpleasant to use, I simply would prefer to have a product that would not perpetuate itself in my regimen. Perhaps if Olay is able to change their formula, I would be willing to try it again. This review was collected as part of a promotion.", {'entities': [(0, 4, 'PRODUCT')]})

After using the product for several weeks I didn't notice a difference in the lines or age spots on my face and my skin certainly didn't look 10 years younger.

The texture of the moisturizer is nice and creamy, but doesn't live up to its claims, at least for my skin type. I have to stick with my usual brands that don't contain any fragrance.

It was the perfect size as it allowed me enough time and product in order to assess all of its claims. The cream is a very smooth almost silky texture and is easy to apply evenly. You need to know your skin though and avoid putting this on your oilyest areas. It was almost like it was too moisturizing for my skin! I started breaking out again like I was a teenager. I thought this would pass the longer I used the product but unfortunately it did not. As far as reducing fine lines and wrinkles, it helped a little around the mouth but my forehead lines remained quite pronounced. It did a very good job at reducing the appearance of dark spots though I have hyper pigmentation on my cheeks and this definitely helped reduce the appearance of the brown spots and help even out my skin tone. Overall, I think if you have very dry skin this product may help with moisturizing and keeping your skin tone even, but I would give it a pass on the anti wrinkle claim.

I then asked my husband, my mother and a friend which side of my face looked better... and they did not see any difference. To be honest, I could not see the difference neither.

("Well, I've given Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti Aging Moisturizer a very good go. Everyday so far (except today). What are the good points and the bad points PROS: Smells nice, feels luxurious on the skin when first applied, good consistency, not greasy. NEGATIVES: It leaves a white film on your skin if you happen to rub your face a minute after you've placed it on. This is true even on newly scrubbed skin that has no dead skin left on it so it isn't dead skin. Also, I think this actually made my fine lines stick out MORE. Before I tried this product, I hardly had any fine lines. I had great skin. I used to use my regular moisturizer and was very happy with it, this cream seemed to accentuate the fine lines around my eyes. I've not used the product in the last 2 days and voila! my skin looks great again, no fine lines around my eyes. This is all hype without much substance unfortunately. Would never recommend!

("I think Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 has some pretty high claims so I was pretty excited to try the sample size cream. I did notice upon opening the cream that there was a slight scent to the cream. The texture is very light and it doesn't feel greasy on the skin. It does make the skin feel smoother and it does seem to hold moisture in the skin. After a couple of uses the skin around my eyes started to get itchy. And after two more uses it got worse, so I knew right away it was the cream. I kept on using the cream and avoided getting close to my eyes at all, which I find such a pain. I didn't notice any difference in my fine lines or sun spots. The only thing I liked was the way it made my skin feel. I have now had to stop using the cream because any residual cream that I may have had on my fingers would irritate the skin around my eyes if I was rubbing them at all. I really wish this cream were scent free and hypoallergenic. I wouldn't recommend this for anyone with sensitive skin.

("Well I was given a sample of the Olay total effects 7 in 1 anti aging moisturizer to try in exchange for my honest review. Well, I just celebrated that certain birthday that some would say would make me over the hill. Do I have fine lines yes, but earned every one of them so when some product claims to fight fine lines and other things, I'll give it a try. Firstly, it's in a really cute and easy to handle package. It's supposed to be a 4 week sample amount but I doubt it. My skin is dry so it soaks it right up. Which brings up one really great aspect of the product....its doesn't burn my skin like other non hypoallergenic moisturizers do. I have been using the product for almost 3 weeks now and other than a great moisturizer, I have to say its not anti aging anything. Would i recommend this product I guess that is ultimately going to depend on what the price will be when I head to the drug store . Its a great moisturizer but nothing else.

("I enjoyed trying out the new anti-aging moisturizer from Olay but unfortunately I didn't see all the effects this 7-in-1 promised. I have been using it daily for 4 weeks every morning before I apply makeup, and sometimes at night before bed. It comes in an easy pump container and applied very smoothly and absorbed quickly into the skin. It left a matte finish and had no oily characteristics at all. It has a very faint moisturizer scent, but is less noticeable than other Olay products I've tried (I like scented products). Of the seven benefits listed the one I did find it succeeded in was the moisturization. It's a very good facial moisturizer and does so without being greasy or oily throughout the day. I was happy to be able to apply it under makeup without problems. It prevented dryness and flaky skin that I can get a lot in the winter. When it comes to the evens skin toneclaim, it was successful in just providing an oil-less matte finish. But this is just to say it looks like my natural skin and that there's no product on it. It didn't even out my complexion though. Now sadly the other 5 signs of aging continued with me. I saw no difference in my fine lines, wrinkles, and crow's feet. And I was surprised that it didn't enhance brightness. I've used a lot of Olay products that did have beautiful microscopic shimmers/illuminations in the moisturizers and this one had none. It didn't brighten at all. My pores were also the same large size I can see them without a magnifying mirror. I don't feel it made my face any firmer either. I have the same amount of elasticity and softness as before. I was really looking forward to seeing a difference in my age spots. I do use an ineffective age spot treatment nightly dabbed onto these spots and have used this for a year with not lightening. My point is that every night I use a magnifying mirror to examine them and after 4 weeks of using this Olay Total Effects product they are all still accounted for and the same size and darkness. I really wish they would go away. So overall I have no difference in appearance to my face and its flaws and therefore do not look visibly younger. It is a nice facial moisturizer suitable for both morning and evening application, but that is as far as I can recommend it.

("I received my Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer. Eventhough I am often mistaken for looking much younger than I really am, I have noticed some progressive signs of aging on my face in the last couple of years. As such, I was was very excited to try this moisturizer out. I have been looking for an alternative moisturizer to combat some fine lines that have begun to form on my face - largely on my forehead between my eyebrows as well as below my eyes around my upper cheek area. The other reason I was excited to try this moisturizer was to combat some of my other problem areas: I have uneven skin tone that appears dull without makeup and I have large pores that are difficult to mask even with foundation. I also have very oily skin but combined with dry patches when I don't properly moisturize. The Olay Total Effects packaging was very nice looking and I was able to open the packaging easily. Due to my sensitive skin and allergies to certain chemicals found in many beauty and makeup products, I instantly scrutinized the list of ingredients. Fortunately none of the ingredients listed matched the small list of chemicals I am known to be allergic to. My next step was to pump some of the product onto my hand to do a a patch test on my wrist. The pump easily dispensed a small dollop of product and I found it quite easy to control the amount that was dispensed. Next I proceeded to do a smell test as I generally do not prefer any strong perfumes or smells to be applied to my skin. I found that the smell was gentle and not overpowering at all - just a hint of floral-like scent that didn't linger whatsover. Next I applied some of the moisturizer to the inside of my wrist. The moisturizer glided on smoothly and absorbed into my skin without leaving any residue or oily feeling. This was a huge plus for me. I repeated this patch test over the course of a week to ensure no hives or rashes. Finally I felt confident enough to apply the product to my face. This was done nightly right after cleansing my face. The moisturizer seemed to absorb easily into my skin and generally didn't leave an oily appearance. It also seemed to moisturize the skin. However this is pretty much where the PROS of this product stops. After repeatedly applying the moisturizer to my face every night, I did not notice any change in my skin. In fact, I noticed dry flakey patches the next morning where I had applied the moisturizer. This was very disappointing to see - especially since my regular moisturizer never left flakey patches. Another great disappointment is that the moisturizer did nothing to smooth out my fine lines and forehead wrinkles. There was absolutely no improvement. My pores were still largely visible and my skin tone no brighter. All in all, I had high hopes for Olay Total Effects but the moisturizer did not seem to have any effect on my skin. Perhaps the formulation and/or the ingredients is not what my skin needs. This review was collected as part of a promotion.", {'entities': [(14, 18, 'PRODUCT')]})

("I just received the lastest BzzAgent campaign for Olay Total Effects and am excited although skeptical to try this product. Being in my 40's now, and recently becoming a grandma, I'm starting to try to recapture my youth. Let's face it I'd rather not look my age. I'm beginning to notice some fine lines around my eyes, the evidence of age-spots and blotchy looking skin. Over the years I've tried numerous products that claim they address similar issues and to say I was disappointed would be an understatement. When I opened my BzzAgent campaign, my first impression was wow, that bottle sure is cute but very, very tiny. If I've learned anything from being a BzzAgent is that unless you try it don't always go on first impressions. So being the objective person I am, I'm going to include Olay Total Effects into my daily regime. Yesterday was day 1, after showering I performed my usual facial cleansing, exfoliating followed by Olay Total Effects. It took but a moment to realize that the reason that the bottle is so tiny is because you really don't need as much product as you'd think. It completely saturated into my skin, leaving it feeling velvety (If that's a word) and not greasy as most products tend to leave my skin. I have not yet noticed a visual difference, but am impressed with the feel of my skin and a very light scent. I've found that the products I've tried can tend to smell like medicine, but this is very subtle. I feel confident that if I use this product daily within a week I should notice some differences, so I'll be checking back in with updates. I'm really hoping that this product does what it claims, to have people say wow, I can't believe your a grandma, look at your skin, would be the ultimate compliment.

('Olay Total Effects 7 in One Anti-aging Moisturizer I was excited to receive this sample because theres nothing I love more than trying new skin creams and am always looking for the *Hail Mary* product at a lower price point than skin care I currently use. Upon first application, my skin felt hydrated and plump, maintaining that feeling for hours. Unfortunately, during those few hours, I developed a rash and the next day a cystic pimple emerged on my chin. My skin can tolerate a lot without ever experiencing a rash but I do have issues with spots of acne following test drives with new products. This just happens to be one of those offenders. I always give products a second and even third chance in case a reaction is simply coincidence so a week later, I gave it another go with same results. Third time was also a bust. Because I couldnt use the product daily, I cant comment on most of the issues this product claims to address. I dont know specifically which ingredients make my skin break out. I do know that typically, any breakout I experience is usually related to products containing parabens or sunscreen. I understand that many products on the market require parabens to stabilize the product. Aside from the suspect paraben related outbreaks, I am also a breast cancer survivor and sensibility dictates that I cannot dismiss the potential association that is often made with relation to paraben content in our day to day skin care products and health issues. When theres more than one paraben involved, its a bigger concern. Stars added for the nourishing feel of the cream, subtracted for paraben content and puzzling rash.

("Olay is not a new brand, infact it has been around for many many years. My Great-Gran swore by Oil of Olay moisturizer. When this popped up on my BzzAgent list, I knew I had to give it a try. Now, I wouldn't say I'm old enough to have this moisturizer targeted towards my age group - but it never hurts to prevent or start a regime that will help my skin in the future. You're never too young to start. First off, I was a little surprised at how small this size was, and such bold claims it made! Younger looking skin in less than four weeks! How! This product claims to visibly smooth fine lines and wrinkles, even skin tone, enhance brightness, minimize the look of pores, visibly reduce age spots, restore firmness and replenish moisture. Smooth on clean face and neck, for best results use daily. This has your typical Olay scent. I'm not really a fan of scented facial products just because I have sensitive skin and I never know what is going to burn when I use it, or make my skin more dry. One pump is more than enough to cover your full face. It just soaks into your skin immediately and provides an instant rush of hydration. It dries somewhat matte. I didn't have a chance to try makeup on top of it, but I have a feeling it wouldn't work for me. I think this moisturizer would be good for someone with normal to lightly oily skin. I don't find that it is hydrating enough for my dry skin, because after about half an hour, my skin feels like it needs more moisture. I prefer a thicker cream, especially now that it is winter.

I have used Olay products in the past and liked how they worked with my skin, so being able to try a new item before it hits the market was great. I am at an in-between age, where my skin had begun to age but not yet displaying many fine lines or wrinkles. That said, the anti-aging properties did not do much for me. I did notice that my pores were visibly smaller, which was great for me as that is a major issue with my skin. My skin tone did have a more even apperance, but I did not notice much in terms of providing any brightness to my skin. The fragrance-free factor was much appreciated as many facial products are overloaded with heavy, unnecessary perfumes. I did find that the moisturizer provided an initial feeling of hydration to the skin, but halfway through the day after an application of makeup, I found the cream was not enough to provide me with sufficient moisture throughout the day. My skin would crack and peel in spite of heavy application of the Olay Total Effects 7 in One Anti-Aging Moisturizer both day and night. Perhaps I'm just not the right skin-type for this item, but I was very happy to try and learn I should save my money.

The packaging is quite attractive, and the pump top is great for dispensing control and keeping the product fresh. I was concerned with how little product the dispenser produced, but with Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer, less truly is more. The cream is very thick, rich and luxurious, and you really only need a small amount to get good coverage. It rubs on very smoothly, and does not feel oily or leave residue. It also kept my skin soft and moisturized the whole day. To the drawbacks - I wasn't keen on the scent it was more powerful than I expected initially, and it had a bit of that old lady smell to it. For an anti-aging cream, the smell did not exude youthfulness. Luckily the strong scent faded quickly so I didn't have to smell it all day. Also, I have sensitive skin, and experienced an uncomfortable tingling when I applied the product, as well as some mild skin irritation and reddening (that also, luckily, disappeared after about 20 minutes). After using it for a week, I have not seen any changes in the appearance of my lines or wrinkles, skin tone (worse after initial application...), etc. All in all, I wouldn't replace my current Olay Sensitive Skin daily moisturizer for this one, and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone with sensitive skin, but it still works decently as a general moisturizing cream.

Unfortunately, since it is winter, I'm not too sure if my age spots fading are actually due to the fact that I'm not in the sun as much, as it's dark by 4 and when it is light out it's overcast/raining or from Olay Total Effects.

I am more comfortable using this product during the day if I don't intend to go outside.

The scent could be a little lighter but is only noticeable when the moisturizer is applied to the nose area. I like that it is oil free and doesn't give a shine to my face and it blends well with my cc cream. The vitamins that are in this moisturizer (C,E) and VitaNiacin complex are bonuses and it's good to know that I am putting vitamins into my skin. However, many creams that have skin exfoliation make my skin rub off into the cream leaving my face with pieces of dead skin that I have to brush off. Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer does this as well but to a minimal degree. I like it more than the Olay regenerist Luminous tone perfecting cream.

As far as visibly smoothing fine lines and wrinkles- I can't say I have enough predominant lines and wrinkles to even notice a difference. I don't have uneven skin tone, so I can't vouch for that either. As far as enhancing brightness- I might notice a small difference- but mainly around the time of application, which is at bed time for me. I will say though I did notice a change in the appearance of my pours beside my nose! The only time I fee as though my skin is firmer is for about 20 minutes initially after applying the cream- and only around my eyes.

It's subtle, but (for me) the scent it does have seems 'chemically' In a Nutshell: Olay says This formula with its VitaNiacin Complex fights the 7 signs of aging with vitamin B3. This product claims to: Minimize the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles Moisturize to soothe and nourish dry skin Balance colour and tone while reducing the appearance of age spots My Experience This vitamin-enriched cream glides on easily and absorbs nicely into the skin without leaving a sticky residue or feeling too heavy. I really like the pump action no fingers in a jar, and a little goes a long way. My skin does appear to have a healthier glow and my skin tone seems balanced out although, I think that's due to the brightening effect, which is likely some sort of pigment in the cream, causing a trick of the light effect. So....not as spectacular as it seems. The unique vitamin formula contains vitamins B and E, which help nourish the skin, minimize pores, and diminish fine lines.

("Ugh! I am so on the fence about this moisturizer! One the one hand, I know the Olay brand has been around a long time and you don't stick around if you have bad products! The quality of the moisturizer is good with regards to texture and consistency, but the fragrance is putting me off and the fact that it stung my skin when I used it after I washed my face. I tried it again another day at night, a few hours after I washed and it was okay. The problem I have, is that I like to put my moisturizer on right after my shower as I have dry skin and I find it works better for me that way. I am torn if I should try the fragrance free version. (I WISH that had been an option we were given) Also, I can't tell if there is something in this moisturizer that gives a nice glow or it is giving me a glow because it's working! Either way, I think under light makeup it would be nice because it does give my pale skin a lovely glow. I also can't tell yet if it is smoothing my fine lines. I don't know about the whole minimize the look of pores thing. I don't any moisturizer could really do that - but I will see how this performs when I use it more.

The product itself has a pleasant scent, but it's a little strong when you first apply it. It's texture is smooth, and even though it's tinted, it blends in nicely with my skin tone. I normally use a tinted moisturizer with sunscreen, and I have found the Olay Total Effects product to be not as effective in moisturizing.

I still see the wrinkles and age spots that I had before. But my face feels quite smooth but honestly, I never really had problems with uneven skin. I have yet to find a product that dramatically reduces wrinkle and age spots. Overall, I think it is a good face cream that will moisturize your skin but I'm not sure of the anti-aging qualities.

But I just dont see a big change in the ones I have. I have always liked the Olay brand and their products, maybe this one just isnt for me. As just a mosturizing lotion I think its great.

It had: - great scent - smooth texture - felt nice after application However, in my case I also found some negatives.

The other negative is that I found my eyes watering and stinging within about a minute of using the product. I tried using it twice but both times I had the same problem...and no I did not apply it close to my eyes. I was very careful how I apply it. Because of this I did not continue using this product.

I used it in place of my regular moisturizer for a week and a half to test it out. First of all, I love the texture. It comes out like a mousse and it just melts into my face. I could just put this on all day. I do have dry skin to begin with, but after a few days I noticed it was even dryer than normal even though I applied it twice a day. I also noticed I was getting more blackheads on my nose but that went away after a few days. I didn't really noticed any improvement in the 7 signs of aging. My fine lines look about the same, my pores are bigger around the nose (see the attached picture), and my skin is dryer and rougher than with my standard moisturizer (it looks shiny in the picture but that's just the flash - it's VERY dry to the touch). I think Olay makes good products and my mom swears by them, but her skin is combination/oily.

("I was very surprised when I received the Olay Total Effects 7in1 trial sized bottle. I didn't think it would be possible to see results by the end of the bottle. I was pleasantly surprised. My immediate reaction to the moisturizer with the light scent and creamy texture. Very little was needed to cover my whole face and neck. It went on smooth and absorbed quickly. My skin instantly felt soft and smooth. Over time, I noticed that the vitamin complex in Olay Total Effects was actually beginning to fight some of the 7 signs of aging. For me, the first signs which began to improve was my uneven skin tone and the fine lines between my eyebrows began to soften. I didn't look as angry as I usually do. After many weeks of using this product my skin improves everyday. My skin is defiantly more hydrated and therefore looks much healthier. I like how my makeup can easily be worn on top of this product and stays put with very little retouching. I will continuing to use this moisturizer and watch as my skin improves while fighting the signs of aging. This review was collected as part of a promotion.", {'entities': [(41, 45, 'PRODUCT')]})

Evens skin tone appearance - Some changes Enhances brightness - Skin got brighter after second day! Minimizes the look of pores - Yes! Visibly reduces age spots - Don't have any Restores firmness - Not noticeable! Replenishes moisture - Yess!!! Smooth and hydrated skin after first application! So, I got 4/7 out of the moisturizer!

("After trying out Olay Total Effect 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer for a few weeks I can say that it's pretty good. I like that it moisturizes well, yet is not oily. I have very oily skin and it does not make me a greaseball at the end of the day. It also does not make me break out, which is awesome. It has no offense smell. I like the pump dispenser which is sanitary. I have not noticed any changes in fine lines nor is my skin tone more even. However, these are not huge problem areas for me. I also do not have any age spots, so I can't say if their claim to reduce the appearance of age spots is accurate or not. My main concerns are to keep my oily face from glistening at the end of the day and to not break out (have acne on my face). This Olay product addresses my concerns. The thing I do not like about this moisturizer is that it contains parabens. I am trying to use more natural products without parabens and other preservatives. If you do not mind parabens then you should try this product. It's good in other regards. This review was collected as part of a promotion.", {'entities': [(17, 21, 'PRODUCT')]})
("My skin is fairly dry and I found that Olay Total Effects did a good job at moisturizing my skin. Some moisturizers make my skin red and hot, but this one was ok. I was a bit concerned because it isn't fragrance free. I don't really understand perfuming your face, but this product wasn't too strong. I can't say I noticed much change in my fine lines or skin texture. Basically all i found was that this product does as good a job as my regular moisturizer. However, my regular moisturizer has SPF while the Olay Total Effects does not. Kind of ironic to have a moisturizer that fights the seven signs of aging without helping to *prevent* aging with SPF!! I also noticed that after about a week of using the product once a day, I started getting some pimples. I haven't had pimples for years, so I was a bit surprised to see them popping up. The only change I made was my moisturizer, so I suspect the pimples are related to that. So, while this product did a good job of moisturizing my dry skin, its has more drawbacks for me than positives.

The cream is slightly thicker than I am used to and it doesn't have a strong fragrance. It applies easily, but I found it took a while to sink into my skin.

("Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer is a great product if you start using it in your 30's, but when you're closer to 50 there's just not enough of what mature skin needs to produce visible effects, it's a very effective moisturizer, but for age spots and uneven skin tone it merely provides an optical illusion, any decent moisturizer will reduce the appearance of fine lines, at least temporarily. My skin does feel silky smooth and it is wonderful for making make-up apply better. The scent is a tiny bit strong when first applied, but that fades in a matter of minutes. All that being said, this is only 2 weeks in, and I will definitely give the product the full 4 weeks and post again.

I have never been much of a person to carry on a regime of skin car but I thought maybe after trying the product and seeing results it would change my mind. I was wrong. Though the creams texture is rich and thicker I really didn't see any difference from all the other creams I have tried. I must admit I did like how soft and smooth my skin felt but other then that to me it was just another cream. Mind you opposed to other creams I've used it is one of the most affordable.

I didn't notice any changes in the brightness, tone or fine lines on my skin. Perhaps after a longer period of usage I would see some of the loftier claims but as of now this is just a good moisturizer. One thing I did notice was the smell. I really dislike scents but this one has a faint scent that reminds me of classic Oil of Olay products. Yay for nostalgia.

I am enjoying the light fragrance, and soft and non-greasy feel of the lotion. The moisturizer spreads fairly well and soaks into my skin quickly. My skin does feel a bit softer and more supple after use. That being said, Olay makes rather bold claims about what this anti-aging moisturizer will do. It boasts that the product visibly smoothes fine lines and wrinkles, evens skin tone appearance, enhances brightness, minimizes the look of pores, visibly reduces age spots, restores firmness, and replenishes moisture. I'm not sure my skin tone looks any more even or bright, or that my age spots are really any lighter. As a light moisturizer, this Olay product is alright, but I haven't noticed any dramatic changes.

Because you cannot put the product back in if you pump too much(which is good actually. You don't want product exposed and open to contamination or eventually expiration of quality). I appreciated the perfect amount that it pumped and on a very dry day i used a little more. It first feels very rich on my skin and i'm not sure if i'm going to like how heavy it feltthen it really just melted into my face. A little goes a long way. The scent is pleasant- almost too strong for my likingbut not off-putting. I have been using it religiously and have not noticed a change in the appearance of my skin. My skin tone remains the same.

("I come from a long line of Olay users. I still remember that distinctive smell that it gave my grandmother. So I was pretty excited to give An Olay product a try. In the past the price along was enough to divert me to my current Aveeno moisturizer. And I think I'll stick with the Aveeno. The first time I applied Olay Total Effects 7-in-1 moisturizer it burned a little, but I chalked that up to how dry my skin must be. That old familiar Olay scent was there- and it's not as appealing as I recall. Actually, it smells a bit like an old lady. What was nice about it was that it was non-greasy and kept my skin moisturized for most of the day. I've only been using it for 5 days, so can't comment on the age defying effects, but since I'd need to buy more to have enough to use it for the 4 weeks that is recommended to see results, I don't think I'll get there.

Unfortunately, even after using it for a few weeks, the results have been underwhelming.

Also, I had to stop using it on my nose, as it broke out - something that hasn't happened since my teenage years. It does have a nice feel - smooth and silky - goes on easily, doesn't have a strong smell, and comes in a cute little container that dispenses easily - all positives.

For me, the fragrance was not an irritant and I quite enjoyed it. My conclusion is that while this product performed well in making my skin appear smoother, it would also be a bit pricey to maintain use. The trial size product may help to keep cost down but, there are other, more comparable, products on the market that can give you similar or better results for less money. I am satisfied with my experience in using Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer but, I will most likely continue using my previous products.

It is a great size for travel, or even for those who don't go through a lot of product and don't want a full size bottle on their sink. After using the moisturizer for a few weeks, I am breaking down the 7 effects that are claimed in relation to how I feel they applied to my use. 1. Visibly smoothes fine lines and wrinkles: I don't have a lot of lines just yet, but this product made applying my makeup smoother with less creasing. 2. Evens skin tone appearance: I didn't find a change in my skin tone - I tend to have redness and discoloration in some areas and this remained the same. 3. Enhances brightness: I did not find a difference in the brightness of my complexion. 4. Minimizes the look of pores: The Olay moisturizer was a nice base before my foundation, and did smooth out my few visible pores around my nose. 5. Visibly reduces age spots: I cannot comment to this claim, since age spots are not a factor (yet!) 6. Restores firmness: My skin did feel nice and smooth/supple after applying. 7. Replenishes moisture: I found that this product would likely be better in the summer for me. It is a light moisturizer, and couldn't quite combat the tightness of my drier winter skin. I have combination skin, but it wasn't quite hydrating enough this fall/winter. I would probably recommend this product for skin that is a bit oilier, or in milder weather. Overall, I found Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer to be a nice lightweight moisturizer which absorbed into my skin well, and had a mild, pleasant scent. It does claim to be fragrance free, however it does have a faint scent to it. Although I don't see the brightening effects mentioned, or evening of my skin tone, this would be a good summer moisturizer, and a handy size. I only wish it had been a little more hydrating for me.

("I am a person who is used to being told I look much younger than my age, and quite frankly, I would like to keep it that way, so I was pretty excited to try Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer as I have begun to start showing the signs of aging around my eyes and thought this was a great opportunity to give another product a shot at diminishing those nasty little wrinkles. I was also quite excited to see if my pores would actually minimize in size as I have noticed that with aging, my pores have gotten larger. On a daily basis, I usually use an oil free moisturizer containing SPF 15, then at night, after washing and applying toner, I apply an anti aging serum. My skin is sensitive and can be adult acne prone, so I decided I would only use the Olay Total Effects and continue with my regular washing and toner habit. At first, I felt positively about the new moisturizer it felt great on my skin, it wasn't too thick when applying and my makeup went on smoothly atop of it. I even told some fellow mom's about how it was keeping my face feeling fresh, even in the snowy weather we had been having. I continued with my new routine for a few days, then I noticed that my skin was becoming a bit aggravated and I started breaking out (uh oh). I became a little concerned, but continued using Olay Total Effects, but still, I broke out and I had to discontinue its use (because honestly, I'll take clear skin over some small wrinkles). I have looked at the ingredients, and although it is oil free (a huge plus), it does contain glycerin, which can cause my skin to become irritated. Although I didn't get to use the product for the suggested length of time to see its full effect on my wrinkles or my pores, I can say that a person would feel moisturized throughout the day, even in harsh winter weather and can feel confident about her makeup staying on atop of it.

("In order to properly review this product in the hopes of helping others make an informed buying decision, I need to use the product over an extended period of time. I have only been using the product for 3 days and I would like to at least give it a week to see what it is capable of. This review will be one of two with this one commenting on the product itself and my opinions on that. I have used Olay products in the past and I have not been a fan due to the fact that they have either broken me out or made me feel really oily and greasy. First off, I LOVE that the Olay Total Effects is oil free. As someone with highly sensitive skin, this is a winner for me already. I break out super easily and although it is still to early to tell, I don't anticipate this being harmful on my skin. It contains a few different Vitamins and claims not to be harsh on skin so I am excited to see what it is able to do for me. There is a mild scent in the lotion but it is nothing overpowering or distasteful - I usually prefer a scented lotion but it feels awkward when it is scented and on my face... I do wish that it was fragrance free but it is mild enough that it will not be a deal breaker for me. As I have noticed with previous Olay Products I have tried for my face, this one is not greasy. Maybe that has to do with the fact that it is oil free I am not sure exactly, but I find that it is fast absorbing as it claims and it does not leave my face makeup streaky or greasy. My only complaint with the lotion is that it feels a bit heavy on my face. I prefer to not be able to feel what I have on my face and this scares me as I feel like it is not giving my pores room to breathe AKA I do not want to break out! Lastly, I love the 7 in 1 idea but I question whether it is truly possible. The sellers for me in this lotion are the effects of evens skin tone appearance, brightness, and moisture. This excites me because I feel like out of the 7 things it claims to do, my three struggles are the easiest three to fix. So far, I would say that I am 50/50 on the product. I like how the product is oil-free and not greasy, but I find it heavy on my face. I love how it claims to be gentle on the skin but I am hesitant on that claim based on my previous experiences with the Olay brand. So far I am satisfied with my three day results although I don't feel it is accurate to lay claim until I have given the product about a week to work. My skin does feel great and the lotion is moisturizing but so far I can't say that it is better than the lotion I currently use. I will update in about 5 days with a review on the 7 Olay Effects!

("I gave this a rating of three even though I won't be purchasing this again because I do think it is a product that lives up to many of the claims. However, I found it to actually be very drying on my skin, and actually by about day three found I was having to put another moisturizer on after it just to get rid of that tight skin feeling on my face. I made sure to just use a regular body moisturizer though so that I could see how it did on other claims. Here are my observations: Visibly smoothes fine lines and wrinkles - yes, Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging did help with fine lines and wrinkles, but I don't think it did significantly better than my regular brand (Loreal) at this. Evens skin tone appearance - I didn't notice a difference, but to be fair my skin tone is pretty even in general. Enhances brightness - I thought that Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging did well in this category. My skin definitely looked brighter when I used it. Minimizes the look of pores - also thought that Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging did well at this. I usually use Biore strips on my nose and didn't even need to while I was applying this (and I was checking closely! lol). Visibly reduces age spots - Another category that Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging did well in. I don't have a lot of age spots, but hey I'm 41 there are a few! It did do a good job at visibly reducing those I do have. Restores firmness - I didn't find that Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging made much of a difference in this category versus my normal cream (Loreal). Replenishes moisture - definite fail in this category. Right from night one when I applied the Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging cream my skin felt tight and dry. I resisted putting on any other moisturizers the first couple of nights, but it was pretty extreme (to the point I was so happy to put my morning cream on).

("Initially, I was thrilled to be a part of this campaign. Oil of Olay has a strong reputation for being a dependable product and I even use the soap to wash my face. As I have sensitive skin there are only a few types of cleansers that I can use. So, when it came to trying the oil of Olay seven in one antiaging moisturizer I was excited. When I got the trial size I have to admit, I didn't read all the fine print and I was a little disappointed that it was only the trial size, but having the opportunity to try moisturizer that was less expensive then the current antiaging moisturizer I am using I wanted to give it a try. I had to use more than was necessary, due to the fact that I live in a cold climate. It had minimal smell, which is important to me, because I am sensitive to fragrances. I was also excited, that the moisturizer did not irritate my skin. I live in Alberta where the weather can be extreme from one end to the other, I found that I needed to use a fair amount of the moisturizer to compensate for the dry cold winter weather that I was experiencing with my face. It would've been nice to have a full bottle to see The claims that the moisturizer was advertising. I found that trying to sample size bottle it was not enough for me to make the claims that the bottle was stating. Overall the oil of Olay seven in one antiaging moisturizer was OK. If I had to try it again, I would buy a full-size bottle. I would however, try it in the summer because of the extreme weather I live in. I need a much heavier moisturizer to combat the dryness that I experience in the winter months here. The trial size bottle maybe good for little getaways where you need a quick moisturizer but as a daily dependable moisturizer I was neutral.

It also allows for an easy and clean application. The product is more of a cream consistency and is lightly fragranced. The product claims to fight seven signs of aging: 1. Visibly smoothes fine lines and wrinkles 2. Evens skin tone appearance 3. Enhances brightness 4. Minimizes the look of pores 5. Visibly reduces age spots 6. Restores firmness 7. Replenishes moisture After trying this product for 2 weeks I can honestly say I did not see all of the above results. I did find that the moisturizer evened out my skin tone. My skin tone was less red looking and more uniform. I also found the moisturizer did replenish moisture and left my skin nicely hydrated for the whole day. As for the other benefits, I did not see any results. I have very fine lines around my eyes but saw no change. My skin still seemed to have a dull appearance. I have large pores in the cheek area close to my nose but didn't find they were minimized with the use of this product. I didn't notice any change in the firmness of my skin. I actually don't have age spots yet so I can't really comment on that aspect. Perhaps with continued use of this product I would see more of the claimed benefits in my skin. I do suffer from oily, acne prone skin. I'm happy to report that my skin did not get any oilier than usual. However, I did develop a few pimples while using this product. Maybe it was too rich for my skin or maybe I was going to get those pimples regardless of what I used. My final opinion on this product is that it is an excellent moisturizer but not a good anti-aging moisturizer. I would recommend it as a good every day moisturizer but would skip it for its anti-aging benefits. This review was collected as part of a promotion.", {'entities': [(15, 19, 'PRODUCT')]})

I decided to sign up and get a free trial size of Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer with the hopes that it's promises would pay off, and that my picky skin would tolerate the cream. When reading the box, this cream claims to provide 7 benefits for younger, healthier looking skin in 4 weeks. The most intriguing for me were visibly smoothes fine lines and wrinkles, evens skin tone appearance, minimizes the look of pores, and of course replenishes moisture. Extra listed bonuses is that is is oil free which is a must for acne prone skin like mine. I have been using this moisturizer every night for 3 weeks so far and my skin is thanking me. The cream absorbs quickly into my skin for a non greasy feel and my skin has never been softer. I have noticed maybe a small amount of smoothing in the wrinkles on my forehead but honestly not a huge amount. I have however noticed a more significant change in my skin tone which has evened out quite a bit, and a small reduction in the appearance of my pores (which were quite large in appearance beforehand). The bottle dispenses the perfect amount of product every time which minimizes wasted product and amazingly my skin has not been breaking out as bad since I have been using this moisturizer.

("I have been using a sample of Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer for the past few weeks and want to let you know what I think of it. First I am a Olay fan. My mom used Olay when I was growing up and she had great skin. I didn't inherit her great skin so I have been using skin care products for as long as I can remember and over the years Olay has been one of them. I haven't used it for a while, I admit I have been seduced by the ads and claims to overnight beauty so I was happy to have the opportunity to check this product out. I love the feeling of this product it is creamy and moussey. It goes on smoothly and blends in quickly leaving no greasy feel or any sort of residue. I'm 52 and because I regularly use moisturizer I don't have many lines so I really didn't see any change there. I haven't noticed any real change in my freckles (aka age spots) or the rosacea that I suffer from. I did break out a bit when I first started using it but I don't know if that was from the product or just me - I'm prone to breakouts. I did find the scent of this product a bit strong when I first used it but have gotten used to it so it doesn't bother me but they do have a non-scented version that I would choose in the future. This moisturizer goes a long way. You don't need to use a lot to feel the benefits. It makes your skin feel soft, pliable and smooth. It is reasonably priced and does as good a job as the more expensive products I have used.

Infact, I completely forgot that my face was not bare after few seconds of application. The moisturizer has also creamy/pearly/off-white colour but it is almost transparent on the face. However, I did notice that if I applied too much, my facial tissue would stained yellowish as I wipe my face which is the only reason I took out a star. This almost transparent moisturizer does cover the uneven skin tone lightly which portrays my skin smoother and brighter. I did not see any lasting effects because I ran out of the sample as we were two people trying it. But me and my relative were sure that this one product could replace most of our routine products on daily basis. I have sensitive skin which burns, turns red and gets bumpy if I use any wrong product. But this product worked out nicely for me. I did not experience any redness or burning. And the hydration lasts so long that I do not need another application during the day. This does make my skin look healthier.

("When I was chosen as one of the BzzAgents to try the new Olay Total Effects 7 In One Anti-Aging Moisturizer, I was a little bit hesitant at first because I always thought of the Olay line of products as being very oily and creamy meant for very dry and weathered skin types. Since I have naturally oily skin, I thought that it was going to make me breakout. But after trying the product, I was truly pleasantly surprised. It wasn't extremely oily at all but rather very smooth and fast-absorbing. I read the information details on the packaging and saw the 7 benefits in 1 as well as the addition of the VitaNiacin Complex which sounded all so amazing. Because I have been extremely busy due to the holiday season, I have used the product for several weeks now before even writing this review so I have really tried the product and seen the effects on my face closeup. I used the Olay moisturizer twice daily, morning and night, and loved it. It was non-greasy and fast-absorbing like it stated. It never clogged my pores and didn't make me breakout like I thought it might. Instead, it really helped with my uneven skin tone and moisturized my skin without making it feeling oily or sticky. I noticed that it seemed to minimize my pores overall and worked well under my face powder. I really liked that it was oil-free and believe that this is the reason why it didn't make me breakout.

As far as age spots go I do not have any noticeable ones on my face so I cannot comment on that point. I look for a product the has little to no scent, does not sting or cause redness to my sensitive skin, does not make my skin feel tight, does not leave dry patches but also does not make my skin feel or look greasy.

("Claims that the Olay Total Effects makes 1. Visibly smoothes fine lines and wrinkles - does make the lines and wrinkles less noticeable, could be due to the fact that this moisturizer does have a bit of a beige colour to it 2.Evens skin tone appearance - does appear to even out the skin tone again, this could be due to the colour in the moisturizer 3.Enhances brightness - does enhance the brightness, again, this could be due to the colour in the moisturizer 4.Minimizes the look of pores - does make the pores less noticeable, again, this could be due tot he colour in the moisturizer 5.Visibly reduces age spots - does not reduce the age spots, the sample size is small (although much larger than some other sample I've received) and might need to use it for a longer period of time 6.Restores firmness - skin did feel a bit firmer but only lasted for a short period of time 7.Replenishes moisture - definitely moisturized and there is less dry flaky skin on my face Other things I like about the moisturizer is that there is no scent and does not tingle when it's used. Works just as well as the Clinique moisturizer in the short term basis but don't know about long term. Moisturizers seems to work well for the first couple that I use then and then after that not as well.

I have definitely noticed some smoothing in my face which is fantastic. I spend a ton of time outdoors in the winter which causes some chaffing for sure. It's been nice to see some of that reversed especially under my eyes which gets really rough for some reason (maybe from my eyes watering in the wind!). I very much luck out with a lack of age spots, but I've certainly found the Olay Total Effects evening and brightening my skin tone in general. Another really fab feature here is the lack of perfume in the product. I love that, and it sure makes it nice around the eyes because it doesn't cause stinging. Now, I've spoken to both the group of ladies that I work with as well as a couple of friends about Olay Total Effects and I've had feedback from them saying that they see a difference too.

The consistency was a little thicker than the moisturizer I normally use so I was hesitant at first to use it as my skin is easily irritated. However, I found it absorbed very well. Like any woman, I scrutinize my face on a regular basis. I noticed right away that my face felt immediately softer. While the fine lines remained after 3 weeks of use, I did notice that my skin seemed brighter within a week. I imagine if I was able to test a full-sized sample for a longer period of time, I would have noticed a bigger different.

Most moisturizers leave me feeling greasy and heavy but this one is so smooth and left my skin hydrated but dry. 3) This product comes with a pump which I like much better than the regular squeeze tops.

I have been Olay customer for over a decade but they don't manufacture the white cream anymore so having a chance to try this Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer was a welcome gift for me.

("We have very cold and dry winters where I live, and so I am used to using a very thick, moisturizing cream. Because of this, I began using this Olay moisturizer with my skin already soft and in good condition (not dry/patchy/oily). When first using the moisturizer, I found it to be very easy to spread (it isn't thick), and it dried quickly. However, I did notice that it left a bit of a sheen to my skin (kind of a slightly damp-skin look). It wasn't unpleasant, nor overly oily, but I do suspect this was what gave my skin a brighter look/youthful glow. Although this did work wonderfully as a moisturizer, I did not notice any difference to the laugh lines/fine lines on my face, but perhaps 3.5 weeks of use is too early to draw a conclusion about this. I don't yet have age spots, so I cannot speak to whether or not it is effective at minimizing their appearance. I have only ever used 1 other kind of anti-aging moisturizer (Meaningful Beauty), which I found left my skin scaley and oily. It was a miserable experience and took weeks to repair the damage it caused. This Olay moisturizer fares so much better. Because Olay has fared so well in terms of maintaining my skins moisture in our harsh climate, I have (and will continue) to recommend this moisturizer to others. Please note that I received this product as a free trail from Olay as a part of a Bzz Campaign, but all of my feedback is of my own, honest opinion.

One good thing, it smells great - a light floral scent without being too overpowering. The moisturizer is also very light and isn't creamy or greasy at all. My skin is quite sensitive and doesn't respond well to new lotions or creams. After using it for a good 3 weeks, I'm happy to report that my skin hasn't had any breakouts or red patches! It seems to have adjusted to the Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer quite well. The husband and daughter also don't mind the smell which is a definite bonus. So, why the 4 stars and the lukewarm title Well, I guess it's because I haven't really noticed any significant changes to my skin. I mean, it feels great but it felt great even before I started using the Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer. Have I noticed fine lines and wrinkles being smoother or reduced Um, not sure, nothing noticeable and the hubby certainly hasn't mentioned anything. Does it even out my skin tone appearance, enhance brightness, reduce look of pores, age spots, restore firmness, or replenish moisture Again, not sure to all of the above except that I can say it continues to keep my skin moisturized. That much I have noticed. Does it replace my old moisturizer I don't think so. Do I think someone would love it Yep. I'm just on the fence about it!

I use to have many dry patches, and dark spots. so I need a moisturizer that will also help with dullness and making it look energized and beautiful. After a month I see the differences.

Who doesn't want to look younger I was particular interested in the wrinkle and fine line smoothing, and the reducing the look of pores. I've officially used it every day since receiving it, annnnnd... sad to say, I can't see much of a difference. In terms of anti-aging, I'm not sure it did much for me that my regular moisturizer doesn't already do, I suppose. Nothing on my face really changed. My forehead wrinkles remained small crevasses, my pores are still as visible as ever, and my skin tone is unchanged. I've attached a picture of my forehead lines before and after I'd used Olay Total Effects for awhile. As you can see, not much of a change. However! I give it an A+ for being a moisturizer! It's smooth, it's soft, it's light. It spreads across the skin nicely, it moisturizes like a boss, and it has a really nice scent. It doesn't leave your skin feeling greasy at all. Usually I'm not a fan of putting on moisturizer on before I go to bed, since it leaves my skin feeling kind of gross (and often leads to a breakout), but when I felt how light it was, I wanted to give it a try. Four weeks of moisturizing before bed, no greasiness, no acne. I have a strangely mixed review for this product, unfortunately.

My first thoughts on this product were very positive: 1-texture and formula: One of my favorite things about the product is how light and silky it is. It feels very smooth and light, even though it packs a punch in terms of performance. I find sometimes products that claim the same as this are very heavy, thick and sticky, and this is not like that at all. It also spreads very nicely and is easily absorbed. 2-scent: This product has a very mild sweet scent, which I really like, because products that smell too strongly or perfumed are not pleasant to use. This has a mild scent which fades within minutes of application. Now, as for actual performance, I give this product a solid 4 out of 5 stars. I didn't notice much of a difference in my fine lines overall, however, I do see a big difference in my complexion. My skintone is more even and looks healthier. I'm not sure this product is heavy enough for how dry my skin gets in the dead of winter, but it's a wonderful cream so far that has kept my face adequately moisturized.

Overall, my skin is brighter and feels firmer. My skin tone is more even, and I've noticed that my makeup goes on more smoothly and evenly, which is a definite plus. I can't say that my red spots have faded all that much perhaps more time is needed for that. For a cream, though, I'm impressed with the effects it has had. I am not into invasive procedures like surgery or Botox, so for me, a moisturizer that does what it claims to do is important. I do wish the trial size had a little bit more product in it, though.

Well I am a pretty tuff critic because I have used a lot of exspensive spa line products because I'm in the esthetic indusrty.

It absorbs nicely and gives your skin a smooth hydrated feeling! I notice a slight tint to the lotion which is probably what gives my skin a nice glow!

('Well, I must say, I really do think that Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer has changed the appearance of my face for the better. My face has a softness and a bit more of a glow to it and do I say that I think my fine lines around my eyes are less!! It will be interesting to see in a few months or so how much more of the fine lines are gone. The seven benefits in one product claim to intensely moisturize skin, reduce wrinkles, enhance skin tone and color, minimize pores, provide free-radical defense, and lift skin. I am seeing a few of these benefits and hopefully will see more with continued use. This review was collected as part of a promotion.', {'entities': [(41, 45, 'PRODUCT')]})
('Since starting Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer I have noticed a visible difference. I have less redness and more even tone now than 5 weeks ago. I also have smooth skin. I do not notice any fewer wrinkles or fine lines. I do not notice a difference in firmness. Overall, I am happy with this product and recommend it to those who want a light moisturizer with a pleasant fragrance, I especially recommend it to those wishing to improve their skin tone. I love the convenient one pump dispenser and how the product smooths onto skin nicely and totally with no residue. It absorbs well and is not oily at all!

When I had written my first review, we hadn't had a proper winter yet (which is when I usually change moisturizers). I decided to test drive Oil of Olay Total Effects now that the colder weather has set in and see if it would fit the bill. I am happy to report that it passed-with flying colours!

('I have been using the Olay Total Effects 7 in One Moisturizer for about 3 weeks now, and noticed a DRAMATIC difference in my smile wrinkles. I recently started wearing foundation as part of my make up routineI was never a makeup person until a couple months ago, and noticed that my smile lines left a wrinkle when I am not smiling (which is obviously not desired by me). This was my target area for this cream, and I have to say the cream did its job. IT IS AMAZING. Those smile wrinkles are almost non-existent now. I can feel a world of a difference in my face. Overall my skin is smoother, richer, firmer, brighter and glowing! I cannot believe what a difference using the right cream will do to your face! However, there is one thing I would work on with the formula, and that is to make it absorb into the face more easily, because if you do not work it in yourself, you are left with little white clumps of cream that did not absorb. But, that can be solved by working in the cream yourself. By the way, I forgot to mention, in addition to improving my smile wrinkles, the pores on my cheeks and nose were also minimized, which ultimately made this a fantastic product to use because I truly feel years younger :) If you have a smile wrinkle problem and large pore problem, I would really suggest you trying this out and putting it on at bedtime every night, and see if it works for you.

("My main concern with any moisturizer is whether it causes acne as I have dry-oily combination skin and choosing the right moisturizer can be tricky. After a few weeks of using the Olay Total Effects I'm mostly quite impressed. My skin handled it better than it does Cetaphil, and that's supposedly the best for acne-prone skin. I did get a few very tiny white heads a week in, but that may also have been the after effects of sleeping with foundation, so I'm not going to hold it against this product. I also found it very light and quick absorbing so it didn't feel like I had moisturizer on my face for a half-hour like some moisturizers do, but still did the job of nourishing. I felt like my skin looked healthy with even a more notably peachy blush on my cheeks a few weeks into application, but I'm not sure if that was what is meant by the brightening effect Olay 7 in 1 claims to have. I wouldnt say my skin looked brighter, just healthier. I don't have wrinkles so I can't say I noticed any skin smoothing effect either. My only criticism is that the cream is scented. While it smells pleasant, I prefer putting the least amount of chemicals on my face and it makes me worry about the ingredients more than I may have otherwise.

The unique formula definitely helped the signed of aging and I noticed my skintone evening out and any hyper pigmentation spots fading away. Since it's an anti-aging product, I feel I will need to give it a bit more time to really reap the full benefits. But so far, it's a good start!

("My opinion on the Olay Moisturizer is that it's quite good. I have very dry flaky skin on my face so for that reason only I probably wouldn't purchase this product unless I can remedy that first. That being said I would recommend this to all my female friends and family. A little product goes a long way and with a dime size squirt covered my whole face and neck. It did feel very moisturizing. As for anti aging effects I would have to look at it long term. For someone with normal to slightly dry skin this cream would work wonders. It seems to be at a very affordable price point and has no strong scent. This review was collected as part of a promotion.", {'entities': [(18, 22, 'PRODUCT')]})
("Olay is such a classic brand. This moisturizer works well, and definitely leaves my skin feeling nourished. For my combination skin, this is a nighttime product since makeup would not sit well over top. (It probably works even better on dry skin!) I did not notice major results from this moisturizer, since I already have a pretty active skincare routine - salicylic acid, lactic acid, tea tree oil. I prefer mild products since I have sensitive skin, and I know that my grandmother is a huge fan of this facial moisturizer in the fragrance free version. A little goes a long way, and be sure to keep it capped so that the product doesn't dry out in the pump to create a clump!

I really wanted to try I surely had at least 4 of the seven signs of aging ! The unique vitamin complex is said to help with that ,I am glad now i did! I love Olay products especially the original body wash and moisturizer they are wonderful! I have hesitated lately spending money because of disappointment and waste when I get it wrong. On receiving my sample of Olay Total Effects 7 I immediately opened the package,and took a sniff , the scent was clean and light, the lotion creamy soft to the touch,the pump easy to use. That can be very helpful when your hands are wet or you have arthritis. I washed my face ,rinsed in cool water,gently dried my face then applied as directed the Olay Total Effects 7. I enjoyed the way it spread easily ,very little went a long way,fully disappearing leaving behind softer skin with no film. After a few days I began to notice some improved tone ,smoother lines and less dryness. Two weeks later there is still more improvement to all areas,even my husband noticed,new makeup lol Nope I intend to purchase a full size in order to get the full experience . I am really loving it so far and feel good spending my precious money on something that gives results. Go Olay!

After using it for a few days, I felt like I had over lotioned, and my skin started to feel a bit greasy, even after washing my face twice daily.

However when I was given the tester to try I did not think I would love it and thought to myself I will give it a fair trial ad then go back to Lancome. My first day I put it on after my shower and immediately did not like the thickness of the cream. I thought to myself - no big deal let's see how it stands the test of the rest of the day. To my surprise I noticed my skin looked softer and the dry spots I had around my nose were gone. After the next few days a friend of mine mentioned that my skin was glowing and asked me what product I was using. Fast Forward to 6 days later and I think I will retire my Lancome products and give my wallet a break and switch to Oil of Olay 7 in 1 anti aging Moisturizer. I am a convert and can't stop looking at my skin. It has not looked better. I use it in the morning and right before bed in the evening.

As far as the 'unique vitamin complex' that is fighting the seven signs of aging goes, my main concerns are fine lines and reducing appearance of pores! I haven't noticed much of a difference in this respect - yet! I've only just started with the product. However my skin is very sensitive and picky and so far this moisturizer has been wonderful. The only thing I will say - and this is just a personal preference - is that it seems very perfume-y! Now keep in mind, with my sensitive skin I usually go the unscented route, so it's probably not even that perfume-y, I'm likely just not used to it. I also wear a mask at work, so for the first half of the day I'm directly inhaling it - haha! By the afternoon there isn't much scent left which is nice for me. As far as just compared to any moisturizer I love how light it feels putting it on and throughout the day, not thick or sticky or anything, instantly dry - for this reason alone (regardless of how much it ends up helping with the anti aging) I'm already planning on buying the full size of this product to add to my regular routine!

It worked well but I see fine lines creeping up when I look very closely in the mirror. My face feels great when I wear the Olay and I love how light it feels and it absorbs so quickly compared to my old cream. I'm fairly red skinned and find that my redness isn't as pronounced now.

She said that my skin looks great and it looks like I had a good night's sleep. However, I haven't seen a reduction in the fine lines and wrinkles around or between my eyes and mouth or a reduction in the size of my pores. I will continue to use it until it is all gone and may even buy another bottle when it becomes available in 2016, just to see if I can see more improvements to my skin. I have a few freckles or age spots on my cheeks and I haven't seen them lighten either. Overall though, I do like the moisturizing effect of Olay and the fact that it absorbs into my skin quickly in the morning before I put on my foundation and in the evening before going to sleep.

I have dry skin and I found that I only needed to use a small amount to make my skin feel quite soft. I loved that it did not leave my skin feeling greasy. I believe it does work at smoothing fine lines. I feel that it make a difference with the little lines by my eyes, but I am unsure if it would be helpful with deeper wrinkles. I guess it could be helpful over a longer period of time on age spots and wrinkles. I did not mind the scent of this mosturizer, but I would have preferred a scent free product.

("I gotta admit, I figured that a moisturizer is moisturizer, boy was I wrong! Olay Total Effects really works! Since I started using the sample 2 weeks ago I my skin is not dry, it really moisturizes. Also, my skin tone is more even and looks creamier and healthier. The only thing I did not see was a shrinkage in pores, but with everything else it does I'm definitely going to keep using it. The trial size is a perfect way to test the product yourself without breaking the bank, but with how wonderful and soft my skin note looks and feels, I'd say you're better off just getting the full size one because you'll end up loving it!

('I so dropped the ball on this trial I really wish I had taken before and after pics because I swear the age spots on my face have gotten much lighter!! I am 45 and noticed age spots on my right cheek about 2 years ago and HATED them they make me very self conscious but I swear after using Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer I see a real improvement!! Not only are my age spots lighter but my over all skin tone has evened out and my skin is much softer to the touch. I was trying very hard not to get to excited about getting to try this product but I really liked it and will definelty buy it so I can see if the improvement continues I love that the formula is non greasy and unscented This review was collected as part of a promotion.', {'entities': [(290, 294, 'PRODUCT')]})
('I have been using Olay total effects 7 in 1 age fighting moisturizer for a couple of weeks now, and I have noticed a nice change in my skin. My complexion has evened out more, my skin does not feel as dry, and it also feels a lot softer and younger. I use it at least once a day when I wash my face, and I really like that it does not leave a greasy residue on my skin. The formula comes out very easily and spreads over the skin very smoothly as well. My only issue with the product is the strong perfume smell that it has. I prefer unscented products for my face. However it does not completely deter me from using the product. I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a new product to try.

("So I received the trial size of Total Effects and was leary. Don't get me wrong, I love Oil of Olay, have used the face moisturiser daily for decades. But did I need and anti ageing one Yes it seems I did! I have been using it for 2 weeks and I have already noticed the fine lines have gotten smoother and less noticeable. My skin tone has evened out, less circles around my eyes. It has been great in keeping my face nice and soft. My face hasn't had any dry spots or roughness. I have been very happy with it. Only thing I noticed was the scent. I prefer not to have any scents on my face. However once it's on the smell does not last long. I will be very interested in the fragrance free version.

("I started using Olay Total Effects approximately 2 weeks ago as a product tester for Bzzagent! I have been a long time user of Clinque in the past, so I was interested in trying something new. At this time of year my skin seems to change with the changing weather, it seems to always feel tighter and gets dry easily. Not this year! Since I started using Olay Total Effects my skin feels good, and looks good too. I think that it's 'unique vitamin complex' has actually helped 'fight the signs of aging' and my skin tone is much more even.

("What do smooth application, non-greasy formula, smooths out minor lines and is hydrating have in common Three words: Olay Total Effects! I have to admit that I was somewhat skeptical of the claims made by Olay. Wrinkle and pore reduction are not easy as you get older... add in some sun spots and you really have an uphill battle! I have used Olay Total Effects for about three weeks now and I admit I see the total effect! Winter and cold weather have been thrust upon us. I am in a snowy and cold part of the Country which really effects my skin. In the winter my lines are amplified and my skin feels very dry. Since I have been using Olay Total Effects this winter has been different! No longer does my skin feel taught and dry. My face feels moisturized and well nourished. I find that Olay lasts throughout the day so I do not have to keep reapplying and reapplying. I also have found that a little goes a long way. This means that you don't have to put globs and globs of product all over! The only con I can say is that I did not really like about the product is its dispenser. The pump is nice that it measures out a small amount but I feel as though there is a lot of product left behind in the container. This is obviously wasteful and costly.

("I've been using the Olay 7 in 1 for about 3 weeks with only a few days missed when I forgot to pack it to go away over New Years. The cream itself is nice. Not greasy. No perfume smell. Soaks in nicely. To say I've noticed a difference would be an overstatement, at this point. I do have sun spots that don't show too much in winter. A summer trial may have been better for me. I'll make a plan to do so. It does replenish dryness, without a doubt. And winter is the perfect test for this! I do have fine lines, but no wrinkles...yet. Hopefully with continued use this too will improve. I'm not certain what retail price will be once it arrives on the shelves but can see myself purchasing the product if it's in the competitive market.

('When I first received Olay Total Effects I was sceptical of how it could differ from any other moisturizer. After using it for two days I still was not sure if I would see any improvement on my face. Though after using Olay Total Effects for a full week I coukd see and feel the difference! My face was not only moisturized well it gad a nice glow and firmness that was very noticeable. I have always had blotchy and uneven skin tones and was very pleased to see that Olay Total Effects reaaly helped even iut my akin after using it over time. The key is to apply everyday.

('I started using Olay TotalEffects 7 in 1 anti-aging moisturizer for several days now, havent seen anything major on my skin, however will say a little drop goes a VERY long way, I have quite dry skin so need to use a significant amount to feel like my skin is moisturized, only having to use a little bit is a bonus to my skin and wallet. I like how it has a little bit of a tint as well. I quite like the very light scent of the cream. Might have been able to report with bigger results to my actual skin but considering the size of the sample wont last too long. I like that being a 7 in 1, takes care of the need to use multiple products. For busy women on the go like me, this product is definitely great for my morning routine.

I love it's smooth, fast absorbing cream and the smell is light and agreeable too. My skin looks smoother and brighter, but not greasy-looking. I think my skin now has an even tone, and some of the fine lines have minimized, but I'm sad to say that the wrinkles under my eyes are still there. I don't have age spots so I can't report on whether or not it works on that particular sign of aging.

Not only has the Olay Total Effects moisturizer made my face more soft, but it in non greasy and my complexion seems to actually be clearing up:) That is a huge relief! I have been using the Olay brand for quite some time as I have combination skin. Although their products seemed to take care of the dryness in some spots, it seemed to make other spots more oily.

('I have been using Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer for a few weeks now before bed. I have always enjoyed using Olay products since they are very gentle on my skin and this product is no different. I am thirty and starting to consider using anti-aging products preemptively to slow down aging, this is the first product I have used that is specifically designed for anti-aging and I have been pleased with the product. While I have not seen any noticeable difference in my fine lines, I was pleased with other aspects of the moisturizer. I began using it at the beginning of winter. My skin often gets quite dry, but Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer did a very good job of keeping my skin moisturized. It moisturized well, yet still felt lightweight on my skin and absorbed well. I only apply moisturizer with SPF as my day moisturizer. Since the trial size of Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer I received did not contain SPF I chose to apply the moisturizer at night only. Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer does come with SPF 15 as well, and I would like to purchase that to use during the day and see if using the Total Effects moisturizers both morning and night would make a difference on my fine lines.

("My first face cream was the classic pink jar with the black top. It now looks like Olay has grown up! The first thing I noticed was how moist my skin was the next morning! I guess my face was needing some intense hydration! I started out trying it at night, wasn't too sure if it was too rich for daytime. But after a couple of weeks I liked what I saw in the morning. My skin didn't look as dry and not as tired. With the moisture my wrinkles looked like they were smoothing out. My co workers were giving me good feedback on how my skin was looking. They noticed that I didn't look as tired. The weather is getting colder so I may try it as my day cream as well. So far so good. Pretty impressed.

('Due to having very sensitive skin, I was a bit hesitant at first to try my new sample of Olay Total Effects 7 in one moisturizer. The next day I decided to use this cream for at least 1 week straight to see its effects. Firstly I was pleasantly impressed that it did not in any way affect my skin sensitivity. It went on very smooth and the light scent was very calming and refreshing. It amazingly kept my skin moisturized all day long while at the same time it smoothed out my uneven skin tone, reduced the appearance of my age spots, and overall, just brightened my face with a bit of a glow.

Nothing yet like looking 10 years younger, but it says you need 4 weeks for that. I haven't noticed a huge difference in my skin yet but it is definitely softer and more moisturized than before. My husband even said my skin felt really soft the other day to me. And when the husbands notice, that's big! I have noticed my skin tone is a bit brighter as well which is one problem I have that bothers me. I think it would be a product that I would buy once it comes out in February.

My skin is so soft and I like the scent also. I have been using it for 10 days now and even my kids notice a difference. Before trying this I was looking for a product that wont make my face all oily or take lots of time to apply and remove. So you can imagine how excited I was. No more wasting money looking for a good product to use. I let my mom and sister try it and they also like the results.

("I have been using Olay total effects 7 in 1 anti aging moisturizer for about 3 weeks now and I definitely notice a positive difference in my skin. Just to give you an idea of my skin type - I'm 26 and my skin is just starting to become dryer, it has always been very oily, so I was hesitant about using a moisturizer (almost EVERY moisturizer makes me break out) and adding more moisture to my skin. I get breakouts in my t zone often and I regularly use spot treatments and acne products. I've been using this moisturizer every morning before putting on makeup and it has made my skin feel softer and more supple. I feel like it has more of a 'glow' that it used to and my skin appears more firm and moisturized. In regards to the other effects of this cream, I don't feel like I've noticed a difference in my pore size, fine lines, or skin tone. I still have about half the bottle left so I'll have to wait and see if this cream improves with continued use. All in all I'm happy with the effects of this cream and I'm THRILLED that it hasn't made me break out!

I was a little put off from the quality of the pump at first but after a few squirts the product comes out smoothly. The product is gentle enough that it doesn't irritate my sensitive skin which is very important to me when looking for skin products. The formula doesn't have a strong scent and goes on smoothly leaving my skin so soft. I have been using it for about 2 weeks now and have not noticed the anti aging properties making much of a difference but I am SO impressed with how well it evens out my skin.

('I got to try this product in a generous sample size which lsted me for several weeks. I was very pleasantly surprised by the product, and will absolutely purchase it in the future. I am in my early-mid thirties, and this is just the type of product I have been looking for. Often I find anti-aging creams can be much to rich for my normal/combination skin, but this is light and absorbs quickly, while still providing just the right amount of moisture. Aside from being a lovely moisturizer, the most noticable results of this product on my skin were increased brightness and evenness of skin tone. It made my skin look and feel fabulous, and I know this because several friends commented that my skin looked glowy, and asked what I was doing differently. I was initially a little disappointed that there was no SPF in this product, but apparently there is one that has an SPF (15 I think), and I am also interested in trying that product for day and sticking with this one as a night.

I am really happy with the results I've experienced so far. I have sensitive skin and this lotion did not cause any irritation-which is a huge plus for me. It keeps my skin so well moisturized that by the end of the day I do not have the tight dry skin I normally end my work day with. Fine lines are not visible through the moisture. I really am enjoying the benefits that were immediate and the long term ones I have noticed like a brighter complexion and a more even skin tone.

I was wrong and really like this product. I have modified how I use it however, because I have noticed in the areas where my face tends to be oilier it has caused break outs (my nose and chin). For the areas where my face is drier (forehead and cheeks), this has given some great moisture to these areas and helped prevent such a dry chapped look. On my cheeks my pores are not as noticeable with the added moisture. It does not feel oily, it goes on light, smooth and absorbs quickly into the skin.

Also, it is hygienic because you don't need to constantly dip your finger in a jar to take out the product. The texture is light and smooth. My skin feels well moisturized and the creme absorbs into the skin nicely and does not leave a residue.

I've only been using it once a day, but I've been pleasantly surprised! The moisturizer is so light and airy, I don't even notice it. No heavy, greasy feeling at all!

So what I really like about this cream: THe container is so convenient for many reasons. One push and you get the right amount of cream to apply to your face + it avoids contamination since you don't dip your fingers in a jar. THat is a big bonus. THe texture is really light smooth. It would not be good as a night cream, but wonderful as a day cream (not sure about cold months though as its very thin and dries out really quick. But I love it). The scent is so mild and fresh. I feel my skin being smooth and already notice reduced fine lines which is great! What I don't like as much about this cream: well after using it for a week now my face is breaking out... So I am not sure this specific cream is the right match for me, but it could be for you. Seems to clog my pores. Same happened before when I used other Olay products for my face.

('I was pleasantly surprised after using Olay Total Effects for a week. I have used Olay products in the past and they have irritated my sensitive skin. This product has been very gentle and I have had no irritation. I have been using it as a night cream. as I need to wear a product with SPF during the day time. The product sample I was generously provided with, was not the SPF version. This was a generous product sample as you certainly do not need a lot of product for coverage. After a week, I am surprised as to how much is left. While I have not noticed much change in my fine lines or skin tone, I am delighted to see a fading of my age spots. I have also been using the product on my hands, and the fading is most noticeable on them. I would expect that the benefits of this product, reduced fine lines, smaller pores and evening of skin tone would be gradual and more noticeable after one week of use. As of now, I am very impressed with this product, and plan to continue to use it. I also plan to purchase it in the future if I find it on sale or have a coupon.

("I was so excited to receive the trial size Olay total effects 7 in 1 anti-aging moisturizer from bzzagent. After trying the product for 2 weeks it has its pros and cons which is why I rated it 4 out of 5. The trial size product didn't last the whole 4 weeks like promised so a little disappointed as well as not 100 full results. The product also has a strong smell when first applying but does slowly fade. I was blown away by the results I did see! After the first usage my face instantly felt silky smooth and much softer!! The product blends very well and quickly that being said it's great under makeup!! After a week I noticed it evened out my skin tone as well as minimized my pores and cleared up my acne prone skin!! Who wouldn't want a moisturizer that does that!!! It doesn't roll or crumble like some moisturizers do! The packaging was cute and functional and I like the pump dosage it covered my whole face-a little goes a long way here!! I'm excited to find a product that will fit into my budget that I don't have to give up on quality! It's also easily attainable. I strongly recommend the 50ml bottle and not the 15ml trial as it did not last as promised. However big thumbs up Olay!!!

("What do you need to know about Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer is that it takes your combination skin and reforms it to your soft and silky adolescent years! No more fine lines and wrinkles after two weeks of continuous use. Those pores that always pop out at you in the mirror are now so small that you barely notice they are there. Using this moisture has changed my way of thinking that there was no hope for my face. The only downfall is the price point which is a little to expensive and the fragrance is not my cup of tea, however it does not last more than a few minutes. Should you buy this product Heck Ya you should!

For myself, I would like to see an improvement in fine lines, age spots AND uneven skin tone, so this really seems like a product for me. I have been using the product for about a week now. My first impressions are that it has a pleasant smell (I hate overly perfumed products and the chemical smell of fragrance-free products), it has a smooth and light texture, and that it leaves my face looking shiny but not feeling oily (not sure how I feel about this last part yet). I have noticed some breakouts since yesterday but am reserving judgement as to whether it is caused by the cream or not. I will definitely continue to use the product for the next few weeks to see if any improvements in fine lines and skin tone are noticeable. Will keep you posted!

I have sensitive skin and they're the one company that I've never had an issue with. Let's start with the good: It's Olay! Already a benefit right there. A well known, trusted company with decent products for my skin type. Also, the product moisturized my skin without making my skin look or feel greasy or slick. Now as for the 10 years younger claim Not so sure about that one. But then again I don't have age spots and don't think I have any noticeable fine lines so maybe I wasn't the targeted skin type However, that being said I WOULD keep using it because it made my skin soft and has a great smell and maybe when I really start to age it won't be noticeable since I've been using Olay ) This review was collected as part of a promotion.", {'entities': [(23, 27, 'PRODUCT')]})

I have a whole host of skin issues like rosacea and mask of pregnancy on my forehead that never went away. This cream appears to calm the redness of the rosacea and appears to have lessened the appearance of the mask of pregnancy. As for wrinkles I never really paid attention to that before and never realized how many I actually have, so thanks for that!

I have been using it for the four weeks, in the morning. I have slighyly dry skin and the cream absorbs on my face quickly. There is neither any whitish cast nor any greasy feeling. It has a medium consistency, neither runny nor too thick, something between a lotion and a cream. It has a very soft feel to it, as in the texture is very smooth. It has a strong floral fragrance, which remains for quite some time. I did not notice any difference in the firmness of my skin nor any visible difference in my pore size. I don't think I have any noticeable lines or wrinkles, so I cannot comment on that. I will say that my skin seemed bright and even but this also has never been a problem for me.

I think my skin looks fresher and feels great after using it but can't say if it is preventing things from getting worse or not. I have rosacea and think it may have helped my skin to be a little less red. I have the beginning of age spots but didn't notice any significant improvement with them.

When I purchase this product I will look for the non-scented version but have to say that after using it for a few weeks I don't notice the scent in the scented version.

Minimizes the look of pores* I personally have pretty small pores to begin with, so I didn't notice this much. Visibly reduces age spots* I'm not at the point where I have age spots. At almost 30 people still ask if I'm 20 yet. Restores firmness* I did notice my skin was more firm. Almost as if I did a face mask.

Now that it has been 3-4 weeks, my face feels great, no dry patches, any redness has diminished, my face is starting to feel firmer and look brighter.

I did not rate this moisturizer a 5 out 5 for the simple fact of the strong scent. Although I do enjoy the perfumey refreshing scent of this product, I find it to be a tad strong and to linger on the skin long after application.

It dries quickly, so when I apply my makeup, I have no problem at all, and the two act very nicely together. As the day goes on, my skin continues to feel nicely moisturized and does not dry up. It works very well, even in the winter when it is very cold outside. I definitely like this product a lot and it makes my face feel great, but Im not sure how well the anti-aging action works.

In the mornings I use the Complete All Day Moisture Lotion with sunscreen and in the evenings I use the Classic Moisturizing Lotion.

I was excited to get the opportunity to review Olay Total Effects 7-in-1 Anti-Aging Daily Moisturizer. It claims to hydrate and diminish the appearance of fine lines, large pores and dark spots. The key ingredients include niacinamide to improve tone and texture glycerin to moisturize and vitamins B3, B5 and E as antioxidants. Upon first use the lotion has a light scent and quickly sinks in making my skin feel super moisturized right away. I've been using it for almost one week now and while I don't have fine lines and wrinkles, I did notice a nice glow. I will continue to use and hope to see additional benefits.

The lines around my eyes, even though are still there, have definitely become softer. That, for me, is a wonderful thing :) I haven't seen a big difference in the size of my pores but as I continue to use this product, I will continue to take pictures periodically. The cream rubs in very well and doesn't leave any greasy or oily finish on the skin. It's great for putting on right before you apply makeup as well.

It's subtle, yet pleasant enough to make a statement. The moisturizer feel light and refreshing on the face and also distributes very evenly with no residue. I have breakout prone combination skin so I am always very careful when choosing skincare products. I was turned away from many other creams because of how heavy and oily they feel but luckily this has never been a problem with Olay. With that being said, I'm not too crazy about the pump dispenser. It makes the amount more difficult to control. The size of the bottle is also not something I would consider in stores because I don't think 15mL will be enough to create a visible difference.

("First off I want to say that I have extremely dry skin. I'm on a medication for a spinal condition that reeks havoc on my skin, hair and nails. Around my hair lines I will even develop some dry patches that will become flaky. I live in a very dry climate that doesn't help towards this so a good skin moisturizer is very important to me. I was excited to start the Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer . I have been using it faithfully since receiving and have noticed some improvements. The flakiness around my hairline has greatly decreased. Overall 80 improvement. My skin appears to be brighter. The fine lines around my eyes appear to have lessened. My skin feels soft and silky, has a nice roast glow to it. Last week I ran into a friend and she asked what my secret was...she said that I looked great.

("Over the last year or so I have noticed that I have two age spots one on my cheek and one on my neckline. When I saw that Olay Total Effects 7 in One promises to reduce age spots I was very excited to try it. I used the moisturizer faithfully until the last drop was dispensed. The spot on my cheek is almost gone! Frankly, I'm impressed! How many products promise such things but end up disappointing you in the end. The other spot has faded considerably but not as much as the one on my cheek. I also have uneven skin tone, some blotchy redness here and there, I didn't notice a change in the reduction of the redness at all. The moisturizer is very light and goes on smoothly. I like the design of the dispenser, it gives you just the right amount to cover your face and neck area. I liked this product, I will have to put it on my shopping list so I can continue using it.

I have always been a love of Olay product so was feeling very lucky to be able to review this new one. When I opened the package I was a little disappointed that there were no coupons as with other samples but was pleasantly surprised at the size of the Trial bottle. The packaging is very similar to other Olay products. I have been using the product for 5 days now and have been pleasantly surprised. I am used to products irritating my skin but this product is not too perfumed and goes on very smooth. I live in a northern town so we have temperatures of about -17 on average right now. I have absurdly dry skin. The first application took two pumps as my skin was so dry, but after 5 days I am happy to report that I only need half a pump, and my face stays moisturized all day. I have not felt any greasy feeling. I have yet to notice any of the age defying effects it is supposed to have, but that would be a shock after only 5 days.

Although, I find in the winter months, I could use a tad more moisture on my skin. As to all the benefits that apparently come with using the cream, I'm a bit skeptical. I haven't noticed my fine lines or wrinkles improve and didn't really notice a difference with reducing the appearance of pores. I also don't really see a restoration of firmness either. That said, I don't really believe there is a moisturizer that can actually do all of the things Olay claims to be able to do.

The pump appears very sturdy and distributes just the right amount of the moisturizer. Before I review the actual product, here are a few things about me.

My main concerns are uneven skin tone and appearance of some fine lines across my forehead. Now for the product... The moisturizer has a faint but very pleasant scent.

Though I am not the target market for this product right now, its something in about 5 to 10 years I hope is still on the market so I can use it! If you are starting to show signs of aging, or have a few too many laugh lines, I highly recommend Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer!

("Before I jump into my review, I have to mention that I am a Sephora junkie. I love trying out new face creams, moisturizers, serums, cleansers, etc... Unfortunately, this love comes with a hefty price tag that I don't love quite as much. Therefore, I was quite anxious to see if I could get the same effects that I have seen with pricier products with Total Effects by Olay. The first time I applied it, I was really liked the smell and feel of the product. My skin has a tendency of being oily so I am always quite fussy with my moisturizers. I was pleased that my skin didn't seem oilier, yet, was nice and soft. Since then, I have used it every morning and night and am pleased with the product. I cant say that my skin looks younger, however, it definitely doesn't look worse and it feels great. The biggest negative that I have noticed so far is that it does seem to clog my pores a bit more than other moisturizers that I have used. However, if I make sure to exfoliate, it is not much of a big deal. This review was collected as part of a promotion.", {'entities': [(369, 373, 'PRODUCT')]})
("I've been using Olay Total Effects 7-in-1 anti-aging moisturizer for 6 weeks. At first I wasn't sure if it would work as well as described. Now after 6 weeks, I am totally impressed! I have a pretty large dark spot at the top of my cheek. The pigmentation of the spot has definitely gotten lighter with daily use of Olay Total Effects. No other product has been able to do that! I have spent so much money on products that claim to work but end up being a waste. So happy Olay is an affordable option that honestly works. My skin tone has evened out a little better over time. I am also happy with the way Olay moisturizes without leaving any stickiness or residue that comes off on a lightly colored pillowcase. I will definitely be buying a bottle. I want it to work in the rest of this big old dark spot! Love the travel size option will be great to take anywhere! I received a travel sized bottle of this product at no cost in exchange for my own honest opinion and review.

("I had net used the Olay products in awhile. I was intrigued to see how the moisturizer helped my skin in the past several weeks after using it. I was very happy to see results. I have skin discoloration on my face from years of being in the sun without the proper protection, coupled with fine lines from being older. Signs of aging starting to show on my face. After a few weeks, the fine lines started being less visible, they had softened, my discolouration also start to fade. I was thrilled to see the small improvements on my face. Do I feel I look 10 years younger Perhaps! I'm 48 and I have people telling me all the time that I look younger. I especially like that this moisturizer has active ingredients that work against the signs of aging. When I chose a product, I always look at the ingredients to see if the claims they make can actually happen. I'm also happy that this moisturizer is affordable and easily accessible. This moisturizer does what is says. With diligent use, you will see results. This review was collected as part of a promotion.", {'entities': [(19, 23, 'PRODUCT')]})
("I tried Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer for the first time couples weeks ago. Before getting this product, I thought it was another moisturizer with promises that never come true, But I was positively disappointed! Since the first use, I felt my skin glowing and refreshed. The cream texture is light and easily absorbed. It does not leave any white marks or sticky feeling after applying it in the recommended amount. The scent is gentle and does not hurt people with sensitive respiratory problems (like myself). The bottle itself is appealing and easy to use. Couple days after my first application, I started to feel more confident about my skin. I don't have a lot of wrinkles yet, but my skin is so damaged because of my lab work and the cold weather. I guess Olay total 7 in 1 moisturizer is perfect for women living in Canada and getting dry skin during winter. I truly recommend this product for all who could use some moist on their skin!

("I think it's a great moisturizer, but I have used it for almost 8 weeks now I don't see any of the results it claims to do, such as enhancing brightness to my skin, minimizing the look of my pores (as I have the infamous oily T-zone), nor reducing any dark spots, which are sometimes left behind from my occasional breakouts. That being said it still is one of the best moisturizers that I have come across in a long time. The lotion goes on smoothly, has a subtle scent, it does makes my skin feel good, although it does feel just slightly sticky. I do find that the pump does disperse a lot of product, but that's ok, as I use it on my neck as well, so none of it goes to waste. I also like that this moisturizer has NOT caused me any breakouts from using it, which is a big bonus for me! Unlike some users, I sometimes prefer products that do NOT contain SPF because I don't want those ingredients on my skin. It's nice to know that Olay offers such a lotion because good SPF-free products can be hard to find. This review was collected as part of a promotion.", {'entities': [(936, 940, 'PRODUCT')]})
("I was pleased to find out I would be receiving this product to test. I am very familiar with the Olay brand my grandmother used their products for years, and I currently have a bottle of their beauty fluid in my make-up drawer. I have very sensitive skin and this is always a concern when trying a new product. I initially tested the moisturizer on the skin on my hand and waited 24 hours before testing on my hand. There was no irritation, which was a great sign, as my hands were already sensitive to the cold weather and extra hand washing that winter brings. I did notice that it does have a fairly strong fragrance, as I noticed it throughout the morning on my testing hand. Even though I do have sensitive skin, I am a rather difficult customer, because I still do enjoy fragrance in my facial products. Because of this, I enjoyed the fresh scent, but it is worth noting that it was rather strong, and someone sensitive to scent might be bothered. The cream applied very smoothly to the skin on my faceI did not have to tug or blend heavily to rub it in. It felt very moisturizing and left my skin with a nice glow. I do have one age spot (so far!) and though I did take care to apply it to this spot, I have not noticed a decrease in its appearance. To be fair, I think more time would be beneficial for this task. I do find that my skin seems to have a nicer tone since wearing Total Effects, but I think I would need longer term use to find a radical change. For me, though, the chance to improve skin tone and fine lines without harsh ingredients is very appealing. I find retinol really bothers my skin, so the Olay is a good chance to find improvement without the irritation. I think this is a product I would consider purchasing and I think offering the trial size is a very smart option for people wanting to try something new without committing to a months-long regime that might not appeal. I have not yet tried an Olay product I didn't like and the Total Effects is no exception. I am pleased with the product so far, but the real test of time will be regular use over several months.

("Thanks to BzzAgent, I was given the chance to try out the Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer. This 15 mL trial size format comes with a wonderful pump to dispense the product (so no scooping out product from a jar and no losing product when you drop the container). The moisturizer itself is a very light pink color. The consistency of the moisturizer is thick, yet spreadable. I pumped out some of the product on the back of my hand and when I turned my hand over, the product didn't budge. This moisturizer leaves behind a completely matte finish (unlike the greasy aftermath left behind by my previous night cream). I don't notice immediate moisture to my skin after application, but after having the product on for a few hours my skin feels hydrated. So far, I have not had a problem with skin irritation. I have blemish-prone skin and this product has not caused any blemishes or redness. The packaging mentions that this product won't clog pores (because it's oil free) and fast-absorbing. I agree with both of these statements. with The formula of the Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer contains vitamins B3, B5, and E. A downside for some would be that the product also contains parabens. Be careful applying this around the eye area if you have oily eyelids as this product can really sting the eyes! Now as for the scent, it's light and mild. If you've used Olay Quench or Olay Complete basic moisturizers, the smell is kind of similar to those products. The fragrance is unnecessary especially since it's being applied to the face, which is why I'm giving this particular scented version 4 stars. For those with sensitive noses, I'd highly recommend going with the fragrance-free version. I've been using the Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer for 2 weeks now, so I can't report any dramatic effects (just yet). All I notice so far is increased hydration and radiance to my skin. The claims mentioned on this package (such as minimizing the look of pores, smoothing fine lines and wrinkles, and reducing age spots) would take more than a few weeks to see.

("I have recently been lucky enough to try a trial size of Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer thanks to Bzzagent. I am always wary of new creams since I tend to have reactions: noticeable redness or breakouts a few days after starting a routine. My skin needs the moisturizing agents found in all the creams but I have yet to find there right combination until now! The first thing I noticed about the cream was that it had a very pleasant, fresh and light scent. It did not feel heavy in my palm and came out smoothly from the pump (at first...we will come back to this later). I used two pumps for my first try and found that this was actually a little too much coverage so cut back to one pump for the remaining trial period and that worked just fine...and essentially doubled my usage of the bottle! I love that it went on very smooth and was easy to blend with no clumps and felt as light as air. It dried vey quickly so I was able to continue with my makeup routine without interruption which is essential since I only have a few minutes that I dedicate to this each morning. It did not leave a greasy residue like other products I've tried in true past but my skin still felt hydrated throughout the day. I have definitely noticed a brightness to my complexion since starting with Olay and am happy to report nourished skin and smoothness. I do have some fine lines around my eyes and although I haven't seen a dramatic improvement in this area I am happy with the other results and will continue using the product in the future. It also made it onto my Xmas wish list this year One of the drawbacks that I did notice, however, was the pump and bottle itself. Since this is a trial size that's not due out until February 2016, I'm not sure of the packaging for the full size version that is currently available. For my sample though, the pump seemed to leave residue so that if not cleaned after each use (or in some cases two uses) it ended to clump up at the spout which led to a crusty piece being pumped out along with the product I intended to use. Not ideal to have to dig through product to pull out the icky bits before applying, but if you remember to clean it wasn't an issue. All in all I found this to be a great product holding up to many of its claimed benefits! This review was collected as part of a promotion.", {'entities': [(57, 61, 'PRODUCT')]})
("I thought I'd share my final thoughts on the Olay Total Effects 7 in One Anti-Aging Moisturizer. I went into this campaign with mixed expectations because I have had issues with face moisturizers in the past where they just aren't made for really sensitive skin. The company advertises that - With its vitamin-rich formula, Olay Total Effects: Visibly smoothes fine lines and wrinkles Evens skin tone appearance Enhances brightness Minimizes the look of pores Visibly reduces age spots Restores firmness Replenishes moisture The result Skin that looks up to 10 years younger after just four weeks. Here are my thoughts... 1) Visibly smoothes fine lines and wrinkles: I did find that my skin was more hydrated and that did help with some of the finer lines that I've noticed starting to appear. I still have laugh lines but with the extra hydration they are softer. 2) Evens skin tone appearance: For me this was true, but the reason for that was they hydration - I live in the Canadian Prairies where we have had days of -18 C before the windchill -30 C with the wind chill - the extra hydration this product provided helped me to reduce the dry redness that my skin usually has this time of year. 3) Enhances brightness: I am not sure if my skin appears brighter but it is less dry which is a bonus! 4) Minimizes the look of pores: I haven't had issues with overly large pores so I haven't noticed much difference in this aspect. 5) Visibly reduces age spots: Again - I haven't had issues with Age Spots so I am not able to say how successful this product has been in this aspect. It hasn't had much effect on the freckles though :) 6) Restores firmness: I think with the renewed hydration your skin will, naturally, appear firmer. I am in my mid 30's so there hasn't been too much issue with loss of firmness at this point for me but I can see how the extra hydration helps. 7) Replenishes moisture: This product definitely meets and exceeds expectations on the moisture replenishment. My skin isn't as dry as it usually is this time of year and also appears healthier as a result. As someone with UBER sensitive skin, I really enjoyed this product, I didn't get a rash or itchiness from this product ( I wasn't using the sensitive skin one) so I will recommend this product to other users with sensitive skin who are looking to add hydration!

('OK this may end up being a longer review as I am going to try and keep a log and then post a couple of reviews on my thoughts. The Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturize lists the following claims: 1. Visibly smoothes fine lines and wrinkles 2. Evens skin tone appearance 3. Enhances brightness 4. Minimizes the look of pores 5. Visibly reduces age spots 6. Restores firmness 7. Replenishes moisture The result Skin that looks up to 10 years younger after just four weeks. These revitalizing vitamins include the anti-aging multi-tasker Niacinamide (Vitamin B3), soothing and moisturizing Panthenol (Vitamin B5) and conditioning agent Vitamin E with antioxidant properties. Here is a little background, I am 34 and a natural red head I live in the prairies which are now entering the chilly, dry winter months. I also suffer from sensitive skin so (as this product is scented) it will be interesting to see how my skin reacts. I have also never been a regular moisturizer user which I know isnt great for my skin. Week 1: I woke up put on a light application of the Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer. It has a really nice texture to it, although the fragrance is stronger than I usually use. As my husband isnt a big fan of flowery scents, Im using it in the morning rather than at night after my shower. The scent didnt seem to linger long and after walking out into the snow (yes, we had snow it was -8 C (17.6 F) when I left). Its now been over 3 hours since I first applied the moisturizer and so far so good. My skin isnt tingling or burning which is a nice treat the fragrance seems to have faded so I am hoping this luck will last (although Im not sure my husband will be too thrilled if I end up looking 10 years younger as Im already 10 years younger than he is.lol). Week 2: The scent is still not bothering my skin which is a huge bonus. So far I am finding that my skin is feeling smoother less dry. Week 3: I had a few days that I forgot to apply this product I noticed the difference in my skin. My skin began to feel tighter slightly flakey, typical Canadian winter skin sans moinsturizer. Week 4: Weve had slightly warmer weather so Im not sure if that has helped my skin or if its all courtesy of the Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer.. One of the lines in my face seems a little less prominent, so Im going to continue to see how things progress. I havent noticed much difference in my skin tone, but as someone with freckles, that doesnt really surprise me. My pores dont look any smaller I havent had issues with age spots as of yet. I look forward to seeing what the next few weeks hold. This review was collected as part of a promotion.', {'entities': [(131, 135, 'PRODUCT')]})
("When I first got this sample, I'm very curious if it really does all those 7 beautiful benefits that it claims. From what I remember from a long time ago when I used Oil of Olay skin care products in my 20s, it wasn't a very good experience and since then I haven't tried any of the Olay face products. Now that I'm in my mid 30s, I noticed I have more visible pores that is my number one concern. The first time I tried the moisturizer on, the first thing that I like was the scent. I'm quite picky or sensitive about the scent of skin care products. Some products are so fragrant that it gives you a headache all day. Even though I like the product itself, but sometimes the scent could be a huge downfall that I would have to pass. This Olay moisturizer has a very subtle, soft smell to it. Not too floral which I'm not a big fan of and most of the time it is what's in a lot of skin care products. I have combination skin so at times it's very shiny. I'm curious to see if this moisturizer would make my skin more shiny after I used it. Once I tried it, I loved it. It's not greasy or gives you that sticky heavy feeling that you have on your skin with a more heavy textured cream. The product gets absorbed into the skin very quickly and it leaves the skin feels very silky soft. After I put the this on, it actually makes it more easier for me to apply the SPF foundation on. The other brand of moisturizer that I was using before I guess doesn't put up to the test during the harsh winter weather, when I put the foundation on the dry skin flakes are even more noticeable. It was kind of frustrating. I noticed that my pores have improved, and my skin feels firmer. As for the claim that it smoothes fine lines and wrinkles, I can really comment on that because I don't have needs in that area yet...maybe in a few years. My skin tone appearance did get better. This product gives you a glow after you put it on. When I looked at the moisturizer closely, it's kind of tinted and it has some sparkly shine to it, but I'm glad that it's not tinted with colors. I prefer this more than tinted moisturizer that other brands offer because most of the time the color is not something that I like or it doesn't match my skin tone. I quite like the packaging of this product. It is much better and cleaner than putting your finger in a jar. With just one pump of it, it provides enough coverage for the face and neck area. Even though this is a little bit more expensive than other skin care products that drug store / grocery store carries, but it's worth the money I think with the amount that you need for each use. This product will actually last longer than other expensive products you can purchase. Great value overall! I would totally recommend this for people with combination skin from what I've experienced because it really does moisturize your skin without that sticky, greasy feeling it leaves on your skin as soon as you put it on. That's a big factor because you don't want your face to look oily when you go out. Therefore choosing the right product for the right type of skin is important. I'm actually very impressed with Olay this time around as compared to way back when. I used to get the sense that Olay is more for more matured ski, but this product totally changed my impression and perspective about the Olay brand itself. Now I kind of want to try the SPF formula that they offer. Wonder if the outcome would be the same. This review was collected as part of a promotion.", {'entities': [(173, 177, 'PRODUCT')]})

("The Holiday season brings with it parties, gatherings and get togethers, and often, the chance to reconnect with friends and family that we have lost touch with. Such is the case for me. I was invited to a house party just before Christmas and was surprised to bump into a former co-worker. After hugging and connecting the dots as to how each of us should end up at the same party, she grabbed my arm and said Kim! You look fabulous! Radiant! I thanked her of course, and then took the opportunity to introduce her, and a few other ladies within earshot to Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer. I always carry it with me for these very opportunities, so was able to pull it out of my purse and show it off. I explained how BzzAgent works, and that this was the latest product I received and was sampling. The name Olay is not not foreign and each of the ladies present started sharing their preferred Olay products. I told them how this vitamin-enriched cream glides on easily and absorbs nicely into the skin without leaving a sticky residue or feeling too heavy, that the vitamin B will help to visibly smooth fine lines, and that the brightening enhancer will help to minimize the appearance of pores and even out skin tone. While explaining all this, I took each lady's hand and pumped a small amount onto the backs of their hand and rubbed it in for them to see and feel for themselves. All were impressed at howsilky it felt, and how nice it smelled. All agreed with me that the bottle is fantastic durable, and no fingers in a jar. I told them how my skin feels hydrated, my skin tone is definitely evened out, and those fine lines seem less visible. We all cheered Yay for less visible fine lines. All agreed with me that this, like all Olay products, is a quality drugstore product, and most of the ladies present advised that they will be keeping their eyes peeled for it when it becomes available in February.

("Warning : long review ahead Okay, let's face it - I'm only 27, I don't exactly have any wrinkles. But Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer is anti-AGING so that's got to be beneficial in the long run, RIGHT! ... I think so! I wanted to take my sweet sweet time with this cream before I reviewed it. I made sure I wasn't using any similar products during testing in order to get its full benefits. So let's go through the seven signs of aging list to see what I thought... 1. Visibly smoothes fine lines and wrinkles - can't say that I had any to begin with... 2. Evens skin tone appearance - 100 YES!!! This is where I saw the best results. Before my skin was kind of blotchy. Mostly from scars due to acne but now they're not as noticeable. I'm not as self conscious as I was without foundation. Although you still won't find me in public without any! 3. Enhances brightness - I think this plays into the even skin tone category so yes, I believe it to be true. 4. Minimizes the look of pores - hmmm.. I never really noticed a difference to be honest. But it's not something I'm worried about on a daily basis. 5. Visibly reduces age spots - again, I'm pretty sure I didn't have any... 6. Restores firmness - I don't think my firmness needed restoring but my cheeks are as firm as a babies bottom ) 7. Replenishes moisture - definitely a moisturizing serum! I would almost go as far as to say slightly greasy though. I would like to add that the amount of serum you get from one pump is barely enough - 1.5 to 2 pumps is a must. Especially if you plan on using it on your neck and dcolletage. Also, it smells lovely! All in all, I think the positives outweigh the negatives. Especially if it's being used for a prolonged period of time (i.e. YEARS). To be honest, I haven't seen it on the shelf yet so until then (and unless the price is astronomical) I'll say that I'd buy it again!

("Where I live the weather here is really bad during the winter. My skin gets super dry and my face takes alot of the cold weather abuse, whether it be that I go out and play with the kids or going to the grocery store. Previous I was using a lotion on my face, but I found my face felt really heavy after applying it and it would clog my pores. I have been using Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer (trial size) for weeks now and I have to say at first I was very skeptical when I first got this product in the mail. One thing that really appealed to me was that it claimed it replenishes moisture, which I have to agree with. I only apply a small amount to cover my whole face, it stayed nice and moisturized and I didn't have any dry skin on my face. Plus it felt like my face was 'light weight' that putting this stuff on it didn't feel gunky on my face. Also one thing I noticed it gives my face the glow I had when I was pregnant, so with all the vitamins and nutrients in this product it really helps my face feel at its best. We take vitamins for our body, why not for our face! I do have fine lines on my face which I hate and I am starting to get the dreaded wrinkles. Since using this product I have noticed the lines on my face disappearing and being harder to see, which I love. I can not comment on all the signs that it helps aid in as I do not have any age spots as of yet, but so far for everything else I have seen a difference in my face. I know it won't work for everyone as everyone's body is made differently and reacts differently, but for me this products works. If you don't want to spend a lot to try it, I would recommend buying the trial size version before buying a full size bottle.

("Just received this trial size Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer last night. I was really bummed that I had already showered and so I had to wait until this morning to actually use it! Every time I'm in the skin care aisle at the store, I always pause at the Olay display. Now I finally get to try it. So first things first - I am a sucker for packaging. I find the Olay packaging looks very 'mature' and premium (which is probably what they are going for, in which case they nailed it). The pump is easy to use, and dispenses the proper amount. Just a note that it took several (8-10) pumps to work the air out of the straw and for the product to come out. Don't give up! ) I always put my face cream on fresh out of the shower so it goes on easier and I use less. This cream was no different. At first I felt like it sat a bit heavier on my skin than I'm used to, but once it was fully absorbed that feeling went away. It makes my skin feel smooth, and has a pleasant smell - bonus! I don't have a super regular skin care routine, and I am blessed with young skin (in fact, I was just ID-ed buying cigarettes the other night. I'm 29!) so I'm not sure how many fine lines or wrinkles I have. However I am interested to see if it will help even my skin tone, enhance brightness and reduce the look of my pores (all claims on the box!)

I was hesitant at first because the least part of my body that I would have experiment is my face, but then as one of my first projects I finally did try it.

I waited for like a couple more weeks for maximum result, right now its been my third week and haven't got any zitz so far ( thank God!) so I guess it isn't really oily and it doesn't clog pore as contrary to my first belief. With the fine lines, I really can't tell that 'cause right now I believe with my age I don't have them yet ( thanks God again!). Skin tone Yea I guess it made my skin fairer and brighter. Age spots not really.. 'cause I don't have them yet just like with the fine lines but hey it did made my dark spot go away! really! so if you have pimple marks I suggest you use Olay religiously!

Now, I can't tell you exactly how many weeks it was but I can assure you it was a minimum of 2 weeks. Since I'd been approaching 40 I started to notice a change in my skin. The pores were larger, the firmness wasn't what it used to be and what I lovingly referred to as freckles were just ugly age spots. Now I used the Olay Total Effects in conjunction with a great facial cleansing machine (which allows whatever product you aaply to be absorbed more deeply into the skin) and I'm in LOVE. I will admit I don't look like I'm 25 but I have seen a real improvement, so much that I ended up buying another bottle so I can continue with the skin care. My pores are WAY smaller and therefore less noticeable. Those freckles aka age spots are almost nonexistent and while I can't say my skin is as firm as it was in my 20's there is more moisture in it therefore at the very least giving my skin the appearance of being softer and firmer. The moisturizer gives my fantastic moisture without making my face look and feel like an oil slick. I have a physically demanding job and when I used other moisturizers I would find my face looked like I'd slathered it in EVOO by the end of my shift. Not a good look. Now I have a dewy look and a wonderfully touchable face. If there are any doubters reading this I suggest you stop doubting and give it a try. I'm sure you'll love it as much as I do!

Visibly smoothes fine lines and wrinkles - while I don't have any deep wrinkles, I do have some fine lines around my mouth and eyes, that I felt were lessened/less noticeable after repeated use. 2.

("I'm in my 40s, and have had my fair share of skin problems such as extremes in dry and oily conditions, as well as cystic acne requiring aggressive prescription treatment. I have tried many products from drugstores to direct sales, to medispas and still haven't found my go-to moisturizer. Or perhaps I have... I am a bit of a cynic when it comes to companies that promote products that 'erase' years from your skin in a short amount of time. Like I say, I've tried just about everything and paid handsomely for it. However, the opportunity to try Olay's Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer for free was too good to sneer at so I was grateful to participate in this campaign. The box arrived with this adorable little bottle of moisturizer and I wasn't so sure that it would last 4 weeks. I realized after a few uses that only a small amount is needed (half a pump) and it glides on very smooth. I've been using it fairly regularly (once a day) for a few weeks and I'm already loving these features: - As with all Olay products, it smells wonderful. - Applies evenly and covers a my face and neck with a small amount - Does not feel greasy or sticky - Does not contribute to oil slicks later in the day - Does not 'burn' freshly washed blemishes - Makes a nice primer for makeup - Leaves my face baby bum soft!! - Give a really nice glow, evened out my skin tone It might be a bit early to say that it has reduced my fine lines and wrinkles, because one good belly laugh and there they are again! But at rest, my fact is looking smoother and healthier than before. I will definitely buy this product, and recommend it to others.

("I am using Olay Yotal Effects for 3 weeks now and i can totally see the difference i use it daily , day and night . I observed that my facial pores close , my skin tone is getting even, fine lines are not noticeable anymore as i have it under my eyes , my skin lighter , rosy , soft and glowing,I feel like 10 years younger, check out my before and after pics and see the difference . I wear it daily day and night and it works magic as a moisturizer, it provides moisture and glow all day and protects your skin from outside elements like dirt, smoke and dust , it works like a barrier on my skin and a great base over a foundation or powder or even without anything on..One day i forgot to apply and i felt itchy because of the weather here, so i went to buy another bottle and put in my purse just in case i forget and it is affordable compared to my previous moisturizer .Getting compliments from friends and hubby is another thing , well now that I look young i also feel young , I shared my experience and they are excited to try it , atleast they said it is proven because they saw my transformation. Love the effects on my face non greasy, very light on the skin , it has mild fresh scent , and you can wear it all day without looking oily because it absorbs fast , It has a mild feeling but potent effect on the skin.I will surely have a merry and glowing Christmas . I told my family all i want for my Chistmas stocking is Olay so i am sure I will ne a happy lady this christmas , can't wait .

("We are bombarded with products that claim to fight one thing or another when it comes to skin care. While I have used many different products, none have matched the quick (and I mean quick) results that I have seen with Olay's Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer. It's a moisturizer that can work day or night with a nutrient formula needed for skin. I used it mainly as a night moisturizer but it can be worn all day. The product smell is gentle and pleasant so it's not a medicated smell or overpowering. The applicator pump itself gives you just enough product you need which I think is a great way to control any possible adverse effects like breakouts with overusing the product . For someone with sensitive skin like myself, this is a HUGE help that takes away the guess work. While trying this product, I did not get one breakout so that's been a huge bonus for me. For the results, while I did not wrinkles to actually notice any difference I did see quite a remarkable difference in my skin specially with dark spots and skin tone. I have been an avid user of the Clinique Dark Spot Corrector which I cannot use for prolonged periods of time because of breakouts. But the Olay Total Effects have worked much better in shorter period of time and I see a HUGE difference in the way my skin looks and feels. With the added bonus of affordability this is definitely being added to my regular routine!! I definitely recommend to anyone who wants to get better results without the huge price tags.

I'm 36, not far off her age back then, but I still had it stuck on my head that it was not quite for me yet. I was so very wrong. First off, that tiny tube has lasted me for well over a month, one pump per day was all that was necessary. It comes out easily, is very light and has a really nice gentle smell. Not at all what I expected. I'm lucky enough to not really have any wrinkles, but I have noticed my complexion is balanced (I have combo skin), not too greasy, but not tight and dry which I've alway had a hard time maintaining with other products. I also noticed a huge reduction in how noticeable pores were, especially on my nose, as well as how just generally bright and glowy my skin looks. I absolutely love the small size, I travel a lot and it's perfect. I'm actually leaving for two weeks in a few days and I'm sad to say I think it's not gonna make it that long. I'll have to pick up a larger one for now. I will get the one with sunscreen though, that was really the only thing that would have made this better. All in all, this is a great inexpensive moisturizer that really produced genuine noticeable results.

("I have really been enjoying the Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-aging Moisturizer. I wanted to use the sample for a few weeks before I wrote up my review to give the best and most detailed review. My initial thoughts of the moisturizer were that it went on smoothly and it was very light. The consistency of the moisturizer is light and non-greasy. It absorbs quickly and easily into the skin. The moisturizer does have a nice fresh scent that I really enjoy. It is not at all overwhelming (though I am not sensitive to scents and those who are might feel it is too strong). Honestly, I did not notice a difference in my skin after the first few days, nor did I expect to see one. However, after about a week, I did notice that my skin felt more supple. Some of my fine lines were slowly diminishing - not completely invisible, but definitely less apparent. I don't have any deep set wrinkles - yet - and so, I cannot comment on whether this moisturizer works well to minimize deep wrinkles. I think it is a good all in one product. I am not sure of what the price will be once it is on the shelf, and thus, I cannot say whether it is a good value compared to other similar products. However, I think if you're spending money on anti-aging products and moisturizers that you use separately, you can definitely save money by using just the one product that targets more than one skin concern. Overall, I am extremely satisfied with the Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer. This review was collected as part of a promotion.", {'entities': [(32, 36, 'PRODUCT')]})

I would highly recommend this product for every day use, but I would definitely recommend the travel size for when going away or just to keep in your purse or car.

("My experience with Olay Total Effects Anti-Aging Moisturizer was great. It went on smooth, not greasy or thick. The 7-in-1 formula with skin conditioners kept my face and neck well hydrated and soft. Its vitamins and antioxidants didn't really hide any age spots, the appearance of pores were less visible , and I still had the fine lines and wrinkles. I have only used it for a week and i think it would need tl be used longer in order to judge if it would visibly promote less signs of aging for younger-looking skin, although my skin does look much better and I will forever use the Olay product line.

With its vitamin-rich formula, Olay Total Effects purports to do the following: - Visibly smoothes fine lines and wrinkles - Evens skin tone appearance - Enhances brightness - Minimizes the look of pores - Visibly reduces age spots - Restores firmness - Replenishes moisture Upon initial use, I found the product to have a nice light scent and a smooth, velvety texture.

Like any woman, I scrutinize my face on a regular basis. I noticed right away that my face felt immediately softer. While the fine lines remained after 3 weeks of use, I did notice that my skin seemed brighter within a week. I imagine if I was able to test a full-sized sample for a longer period of time, I would have noticed a bigger difference.

I also notice that is has more of a smooth texture and not greasy on my skin type. Day two.. Dry patches are becoming less flaky. Skin feels soft and smooth to the touch also there is no noticeable blemishes forming. Dont notice any difference with wrinkles or age/sun spots but its still early Day 3.. Dry patches visibly reduced. Make up goes on much smoother and my skin feels plumped up and hydrated. It doesn't break down under makeup or cause greasyness. So far no blemishes either. Day 4-5. Skin feels so smooth, makeup gliding on like a dream, how ever my water based foundation doesn't combine well. So I've been using a less favorable foundation. Not noticing any difference in lines or pigmentation/sun spots but still hopeful. Day 6-7. Noticing a few very dark black heads, but no white heads. Skin is still feeling smooth.. Nearly all dry patches are gone. Skin is feeling plumper and so soft. 8-14. Slight fading of age spots, noticeable plumping and smoothness of skin.

The feel of it on my skin was silky and refreshing. I did notice my skin tone is evenning out. I'm not sure about age spots yet but I was trying to pay attention to the fine lines that are around my eyes and without taking a picture everyday I really can't say that it made them disappear but I can say that they did not get worse or more pronounced.

("Olay moisturizer Day one.. Upon application my skin feels silky soft and hydrated. Normally i have extremely dry flaky skin so the extra boost of hydration is a must. I also notice that is has more of a smooth texture and not greasy on my skin type. Day two.. Dry patches are becoming less flaky. Skin feels soft and smooth to the touch also there is no noticeable blemishes forming. Dont notice any difference with wrinkles or age/sun spots but its still early Day 3.. Dry patches visibly reduced. Make up goes on much smoother and my skin feels plumped up and hydrated. It doesn't break down under makeup or cause greasyness. So far no blemishes either. Day 4-5. Skin feels so smooth, makeup gliding on like a dream, how ever my water based foundation doesn't combine well. So I've been using a less favorable foundation. Not noticing any difference in lines or pigmentation/sun spots but still hopeful. Day 6-7. Noticing a few very dark black heads, but no white heads. Skin is still feeling smooth.. Nearly all dry patches are gone. Skin is feeling plumper and so soft. 8-14. Slight fading of age spots, noticeable plumping and smoothness of skin.

I do not suffer from constant break outs or enlarged pores.

The only negative thing that I would say is that the trial size bottle spout clogs slightly but it has no effect on the product inside, thus, I will not take away from my rating.

I used over the Christmas holidays, which tends to be a stressful time for me as I'm the main holiday planner for dinner and holiday parties. Normally I feel, (and look!), a bit haggard. Well, this year, my guests were commenting that I looked great, and that I glowed...and asked if I was using a new product. Lol! My personal opinion is that it did seem to help reduce/eliminate the fine lines around my eyes, and my skin tone seemed to even out...I have some areas where my face just seems a few different shades, and this worked to blend them together, somehow. My face just seem to look fresher -- it's hard to describe, but I looked and felt a lot better than I did prior to using the Olay moisturizer. And, my friends noticed! The texture of the moisturizer was smooth, and I didn't have any allergic reactions. I have had reactions to other products, but had no issues with this one -- in fact, I'm almost certain to purchase more when it arrives on store shelves. I'll be keeping my eye open for it!

('When it comes to anti aging products I am just starting my struggle of weeding through the no goods to find something that holds up to its claims. With Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer i think i have found a winner. I am in love with how soft and supple my face feels even just after a few uses. I usually have quite a dry T zone and this has disappeared! My small little dark spots from hitting the beach and not be prepared for the sun are slowly vanishing with each day that I have used the moisturizer. The vitamin complex is doing wonder for the whole quality of my skin, I am so impressed. I love the bottle dispenser, so easy to pump and apply no unscrewing a lid.

Ironically, back then, everyone guessed I was about 10 years younger than I was (miss those days). Once I hit 40 I thought I better step up my skincare game since I'm older. But, sometimes if it aint broke don't fix it. I started experimenting with skin care a lot, whereas in my 20's and 30's I used only Olay. I guess I figured I had to buy more expensive products once I hit my 40's. This is the first time I've gone back to Olay, and I have to say I am really happy with it! I love the subtle fragrance and the consistency of this lotion. It is extremely hydrating without being greasy. It absorbs right into the skin leaving no sticky residue or film. I am prone to breakouts and Olay has never caused breakouts for me, and still doesn't. I know that Olay contains great ingredients for the skin too. I am noticing a really big difference in my skin overall, and especially the skin on my aging neck, it looks so smooth and young compared to before. Now I'm wondering why I ever stopped using Olay.

I find one pump from the bottle is more than enough to do my whole face and my neck. I look forward to also trying the moisturizer by this line with the SPF 15 that is also another great option to prevent wrinkles and sun damage. I'm heading to the store tomorrow to get a brand-new shiny bottle of this and I'll pass my trial onto my friend so she can enjoy the wonderful benefits as well. Thank you buzz agent and Olay for giving me to opportunity to try this product. This review was collected as part of a promotion.", {'entities': [(47, 51, 'PRODUCT')]})
('My mother has always told me to keep my skin moisturized to avoid aging quickly and to avoid the sun. Drinking a lot of water to improve elasticity. I have found my miracle in a bottle. Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer is the best thing in the world. This moisturizer is really good and it lives up to all of its promises. The product goes on smoothly and it feels light weight but it protects my skin. After using it for a week I had noticed that my skin was smoother and my wrinkles was reduced because my skin was feeling really moisturized. My blotchy red spots was evened out. I also noticed that my skin was brighter and less dull looking, my skin looks a little dull during the winter due to drier skin. The pores on my nose was reduced. My skin had gotten its elasticity back and felt firmer to the touch. I have even noticed that the dark patches under my eyes have been reduced. I have been really lucky to have been chosen to try this product from BzzAgent. This product is truly a miracle in a bottle. I have recommended this product to all my friends and relatives.

("I have been a user of Olay products for almost 20 years and I have always thought they were great products, Total Effects is no different. I have not only been a purchaser of the product for years but I have also purchased it for other people as gifts and encouraged them to buy it on their own. It is a great moisturizer. During this campaign I have mentioned it to many family and friends as I have over the years and encouraged those that haven't already purchased Olay products to give them a chance because I have found that they are the best products to see lasting results over many years of use. They might not be great for short term fast effects but for the long term they are excellent. Most people that I talk to about Olay products are very open to trying them and many have become long term users over the years. I feel like I am always telling people how great Olay products are so i guess you could say that I buzz about them constantly not just during this campaign :) I will continue to be an Olay user for years to come, I am always excited to see what kinds of products they are coming up with and am usually the first to try the new creams they release.

("What a great time to be able to sample this Olay Moisturizer. In the winter my skin gets much drier then normal with the cold air and the lack of humidity in the house. This Olay moisturizer worked wonderfully to both moisturize and make my skin look better overall. My skin has a more even appearance and looks a lot brighter than it did. My pores seem smaller too. I don't have any wrinkles or fine lines luckily so I can't attest to how this works on them. In conclusion I am very happy with this product and would consider purchasing it in the future. I must also say that a little goes a long way and the sample size lasted quite a while so if anyone is worried about cost savings don't be.

("I was very excited to receive my free sample of Olay Total Effects 7 in One Anti-Ageing Moisturizer from BzzAgent. I love the clean fresh scent and the texture is perfect - not heavy and oily or so light it feels watery. My skin absorbed this moisturizer right away and my foundation seemed to apply much smoother (a definite bonus). I've been using this moisturizer for 22 days now and I've already noticed less wrinkles, fine lines, greater firmness and more even skin tone (less redness on my cheeks). I've suffered for years with a stubborn dry patch of skin on the bridge of my nose and now it is all but gone -amazing moisture retention!

I suffer from migraines so having a product that doesn't have a strong smell is very important to me. I still have another 2 weeks to go but I can honestly say that already I am seeing a bit of a difference especially around my eye area. I have not used this product before and I know that I will be buying more once my trial size is finished. I feel good about this product and feel confident that based on what I have seen so far that it truly does help fight the signs of aging. My skin tone is uneven and this seems to have helped because I no longer look in the mirror and see the splotches that I did before. Way to go Olay!

("Since I've started using Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer my skin feels alot healthier in general. It feels tighter, more moisturized, softer and less oily. The unique vitamin complex found in Olay's cream helps to fight against the 7 signs of aging including evening out skin tone, reducing fine lines and eliminating age spots. I found I did not need to use much of this cream per use which is fabulous so you can extend the life of your bottle. Also I would not wake up with an oily face after using this, many other creams make my face feel very oily unfortunately. I highly recommend buying this product. If you're still not convinced you can buy the trial sized bottle instead of fully committing to a full bottle, which is fantastic as well :) :) This review was collected as part of a promotion.", {'entities': [(25, 29, 'PRODUCT')]})

It is a light moisturiser which spreads easily with a loght scent but doesn't irritate my overly sensitive skin. As with other reviews I've read, one pump is enough to cover my face and neck completely. I like how it has a pump instead of dipping your fingers into a pot which makes it hygenic! It makes my skin feel really smooth and not only gives it a healthy appearance it feels healthier and my pores look smaller.

("I haven't had a chance to use the product for the full four weeks to really comment on the 7 benefits of the product, but so far I like what I'm using! I'm pretty picky about my face products and was a strict Biotherm girl! However, I really think I could switch to Olay after this. First of all there is the price point differnce between my usual brand and Olay. Olay is much more affordable than Biotherm. Secondly, I love the way my skin feels right now. I can't say if it's fighting off those fine lines as I sit here and type this, but I can say that I have much smoother skin and the tone feels more even! I find that my skin doesn't dry out as fast using Olay. Normally the air is much drier at this time of year and I need to get my skin treatment on my face as soon as I get out of the shower or my face gets very flakey. I find now with Olay I can wait a few minutes before jumping into my skin care routine and by the time I put on my pressed powder my skin is still soft and not dry. The moisture level is great! Overall I give this product an A+ and I will certainly buy it when I run out of the sample size! This review was collected as part of a promotion.", {'entities': [(266, 270, 'PRODUCT')]})

Since I've started using Olay Total Effects, I haven't had any dry skin on my face at all! It doesn't leave any greasy residue behind, it goes on smoothly, dries quickly, and it does all this without drying out sensitive facial skin.

This year I turned 40 and I noticed little lines and a dullness to my complexion that seemed to sneak up over night. Lucky for me, I was chosen to try Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer for the last month. Today I am happy to say that I look younger and refreshed. I can easily leave my house without makeup and for once I don't stress what others see. I have a new found confidence. Hard Canadian winters tend to make my skin dry and flaky. This is the first winter my skin is flake free and soft. Even my husband noticed the difference...lets keep the secret between us. Bottom line...my lines are softer, age spots are a thing of the past and my face is brighter and my skin tone is even...best part is moisture for days! Ps. The pump is easy to use, and the scent is light and divine.

('I received the sample and I just finished my second week of using it day and night so going on my third week. At first when using Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer i did not really care for it, it seemed like it did not have enough moisturizing to it, but I gave it a chance still and especially night time I found the results much better for moisturizing. I can see that my tone is evening out slightly right now and my skin feels great. I find the sample is plenty to use, one suggestion to those who are using this product or any product is that a little goes a long way, never understood why people think that they should coat their face with a thick layer of cream or lotion when less then half the amount of that works great. I find one pump of the Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer is plenty enough to see results. Going on week 3 as I stated at the start of this post. Looking forward to seeing what new surprise I see each day I wake up :). But thus far really like the product, does not have a major fragrance smell to it and seems quite gentle to the skin.

Ive been using my free sample as a day cream for a week now and thanks to the unique recipe of vitamins (Niacinamide (Vitamin B3), Panthenol (Vitamin B5) and antioxidant Vitamin E ), my skin is already noticeably less red, more fully moisturized and even-looking. The texture of Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer is perfect -- it goes on easily, its not too oily or gloppy and it doesn't leave your skin feeling dry. There's no stinging or redness (a real shocker since my skin is super sensitive, and this is a drug store brand). It works well under make-up, I tried it successfully as a primer under two different make-up counter products. It has already healed up some dry spots that arrived with cold dry winter air. The only downside: my sample is scented, next time I'll try the unscented option.

('Now I know why my Granny and even her Mama swear by the Olay brand! the second I took that first pump out of the bottle I was brought back to amazing memories of both the amazing ladies in my life. It smells like them! That is such an amazing thing for me. (Mainly because I do not handle sent well at all) This I SOO can! But wait there is more! I am almost 2 weeks into using this trile size bottle and have already gone to the store to see how much it will cost to get a full size bottle of the exact same product, when I run out. No product to-date for myself has hydrated and moisturized my face like this product. It last ALL day, with no need for reapplication. That alone is enough for me to be a repeat customer. I find I am having a bit of a glow to my skin as well. Not a bad thing with winter almost here.

("used this anti- aging cream for almost two weeks now. I used the Olay 7 Total Effects in the morning and before bed. I found the highlights of this cream to be that it did not leave my face greasy, that I noticed a change in the smoothness of my skin, my face appeared more radiant, my pores went from very big to small medium in size and overall my skin looked supple and healthy. I was given compliments on the look of my skin by my boyfriend and that was an eye opener as we don't usually perceive men to notice such things. I have gone out and bought a full size bottle of Olay 7 Total Effects cream and have and will continue to use it in the morning and before bed. I would highly recommend this cream to anyone who may worry about a cream being to greasy as it did not clog my pores nor cause me any blemishes.

Now that I have come to an age where I have to really start taking care of my skin and dealing with the issues that come with time, this is definitely a product I will continue to use. I noticed a difference with the fine lines around my eyes and how even my skin tone was.

("So the first difference I have noticed with this product is that the very visible age spot on my cheek has been significantly reduced. This has been a source of embarrassment for me over the past few years, because it could not be covered by make up and I'm not that old!! It first appeared during my pregnancy 4 years ago and I never thought that it would go away. It's still not completely gone, but I feel that with regular usage, I could reduce it even further. I am SO thankful for this. I wish I had taken a before and after shot. I have not noticed it reducing my fine lines yet, but I expect that it will over time. The moisturizer itself leaves my skin feeling soft and supple during these cold winter days that can be hard on my face.

("I started using Olay Total Effects moisturizer when I was 35 years old that was many years past. I stopped 2 years ago since I was also experimenting on different kinds of brand i let go of it. Its not always included in my budget. The thing is once you reached the age of 40, you will notice fine lines, wrinkles, youthful skin no more. Since Bzz Agent offered me to try and review Olay Total Effects definitely its a yes! Its like seeing your long lost love and be reunited once more. When using the moisturizer gently pat it on your face, no rubbing please. It will penetrate more in your skin with its unique vitamin complex ingredients. The result is absolutely the same as it was before, reduced fine lines, even skin tone, youthful looking skin with a glow! I am now in need to get the full size bottle to make up with my lost years!

("I think that the Olay Effects 7 in 1 is a miracle worker. Like you , I've tried many different products and home remedies. None of those had worked for me. When I became pregnant a little over 2 years ago , I had the pregnancy dark spots on my face and my face was just plainly discoloured all over. My sleeping had gotten worse and the bags under my eyes had gotten even darker. I had swelled up so much that my skin started to sag. After having my son and my body got back to itself again, the nurses and doctor had assured me that my skin would return to normal and the dark spots would go away within a few months. It's been over 2 years and finally I've found a product to take away the uneven skin tone , reduce the colour of my dark spots that were supposed to go away , firmed up my skin , reduced the deeply embedded lines. If that wasn't a big enough bonus for me , I finally get to throw all my facial creams in the garbage and put that money to use elsewhere. Of course some of the money freed up will be used for Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer. This review was collected as part of a promotion.", {'entities': [(17, 21, 'PRODUCT')]})

Olay Total Effects 7 claims to visibly smooth lines and wrinkles which I believe that it does. It evens the tone of my skin which is does. I often have redness and this products calms that. It enhances brightness and makes my skin appear healthier. It mildly reduces the appearance of pores. It helps with age spots and firmness in my mom's skin and replenishes moisture.

It has a lovely soft scent to it and the pump that I was given with my free trial pumps out the perfect amount.

("I have never tried Olay before but I am very pleased with this product! Me: I have sensitive-combo skin. Prone to blemishes and can be dry during the winter. The Product: This comes in a hygenic pump applicator. I have found one pump gives enough product to use on my face and neck. The cream itself is quite thick and took a little longer to soak in than others. It has a pleasant light fragrance. A little goes a long way. The first time I applied 2 pumps and was left looking a bit white and pale like I was wearing thick sun screen. One pump is plenty! Effects: I was very surprised at how gentle this is! When I first tried it I had a terrible cold and my nose was very sore / raw but when I applied this it didn't sting at all. It has got rid of my dry skin without leaving me feeling greasy. I've had no reaction and I can apply makeup on top of it without any streaks or smudges (as long as I let it completely soak in first). Overall: very pleased. It is light enough for you to forget you have it on but strong enough to keep your skin moisturised, soft and smooth.

("When I first started using Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti Aging Moisturizer, I liked it but I didn't love it. Now that I have finished using the trial bottle, I have definitely noticed a huge improvement in my skin and it looks so much better without makeup. My skin tone is much more even and my fine lines are less noticeable. It was especially helpful with my forehead wrinkles as they seem more plumped up. At first, I wasn't too happy with the scent of this cream but it really does grow on you. It smells very fresh and the scent eventually disapates so it's really not too bad. I love how easy it is to spread on my face as it has a light, smooth texture. I use this after my Olay Daily Facials and my skin feels like its been treated at a spa.

("I loved this stuff! My skin is ultra sensitive, but I found this moisturizer to perfectly compliment my combination skin type. All I needed was a tiny dab to perfectly nourish my skin. I loved how it really reduced my pores and evened out my skin. It even somehow seemed to reduce my oiliness! I wore it both alone and under my makeup, and it didn't melt like most moisturizers. It felt light and airy. I also liked that it didn't have any SPF in it. Some people swear by it, but I seem to react to it so it's nice to have that option. It also didn't make me break out in acne as most moisturizers tend to do. How I'd rate this: Visibly smoothes fine lines and wrinkles: N/A (no wrinkles on this face...yet!) Evens skin tone appearance: 5/5 Enhances brightness: 4/5 Minimizes the look of pores: 5/5 Visibly reduces age spots: 5/5 (no age spots, but my freckles could be comparable) Restores firmness: N/A Replenishes moisture: 5/5 Would I buy this When I did some research recently on the top moisturizers for my type of skin, Olay was up in the Top 5 so, YES, definitely!

('Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer.. I was on the fence with it.. I wasnt sure it really did much for my skin.. Then i stopped using it for a couple days and my skin took notice! I hadnt realized but with it my skin stayed clearer, less oily, my pores were tighter and my skin as a whole just felt more firm. Im only 32 and have only a few lines so far but never really pictured myself using an anti-aging cream of any sort.. But I am now hooked.. Without the nightly moisturizer my skin changed so much for the worse.. My pores were more obvious and i started having a couple breakouts because my skin was becoming oily again.

("In my original review, I was planning on doing a side by side, before/after comparison. I have been using the product daily for 3-4 weeks, but unfortunately don't see significant changes that would warrant a comparison. To be fair, I had been using a Neutrogena anti-aging cream for several months before I got this campaign (and a different Olay face cream for years before that). Therefore, I don't think there was much 'reversing' that needed to be done. What it DID do was keep my face soft and moisturized all day and throughout the night, and maintained the 'work' that had been done for years before that. In other words, it's on par with the other stuff I already use. It bears repeating that it's light and fluffy, and smells delish so it may well be something that I switch to in the future (once my other products run out). As always, it will be dependent on price but the other lotion I use isn't cheap so that probably isn't hard to beat.

My regular routine consists of the following steps: 1) SK-II beauty essence (everyone who is of Asian descent will know of this premium Max Factor line from Japan), 2) Estee Lauder night repair concentrate and 3) finally finish off with a generous layer of Hada Labo Tokyo skin plumping gel cream (this is a very popular line from Japan for its hydrating power due to effective Hyaluronic Acid content). Since the Olay Total Effect Moisturizer claims to deliver the 7 anti-aging effects in ONE product, I have religiously stuck with this half face trial for 20 days to give it the ultimate test. I must say from the first morning off, I was pretty amazed that both sides of the face looked and felt pretty much the same. And this condition has lasted through all three weeks. I honestly cannot say the right side of my face where I have used 3 much more expensive products looks better than the other side. From a cost effectiveness' perspective, the Olay side doesn't only save 2/3 of my nightly skincare cost, it actually saves about 5-6 times of the cost because each of the 3 products in my routine is at least 2-3 times the price of Olay 7-1. On top of that, of course there's also the time-saving concern as I need to wait for one product to fully absorb before I layer on the next one. So needless to say, Olay 7-in-1 is a winner in that department as well. After the 3-week trial, I will for sure add Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Moisturizer to my regular nightly skincare routine. I will save the other pricier items (for which I still have a lot of faith) for those days when my skin needs some extra care and pampering!

("I think Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer is a really great Moisturizer and is very light weight formula and smells great, and goes on real nice and smooth, Not only did i notice a huge difference in my skin tone, but i noticed a difference in the fine lines around my eyes and and forehead! This stuff really does work well, and it only takes a little amount of moisturizer and it spreads evenly and easily around your face. Not too oily or greasy just a great texture and smell. The unique vitamins complex really does work and i did notice results quite quickly ,and you will notice your skin brighten up and look refreshed and hydrated right after you apply it. It also does not irate my eyes or skin, like some moisturizer do. I loved this product so much that when i was done with my sample size that BzzAgent had sent to me complimentary to try and review, which was a good size sample i may add and i was able to see results with it. I went and purchased a full size bottle of Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer, a couple of weeks ago so i could continue to see results from the unique vitamin complex and continue to see results in my skin tone, completion, and fine lines and my skin continues to look refreshed and younger thanks to this amazing Moisturizer and believe i will continue to see results if i continue to use this moisturizer. I highly recommend this product ladies if your looking to help fight the seven signs of aging and looking to see results quickly at affordable price , from a reliable brand this moisturizer is a product you must purchase and try for your self. I also want to add that i'm not just saying this product works because i got the sample free i actually put my money where my mouth was and went out and purchased a full size bottle of Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer for a great price and it's a great size,easily to dispense product and you really do see results fast and it's light enough on your skin that you can really use it every day.

("Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti Aging Moisturizer claims to help with 7 problems Visibly smoothes fine lines and wrinkles, evens skin tone appearance, enhances brightness, minimizes the look of pores, visibly reduces age spots,restores firmness and replenishes moisture but does it really work and do all 7 of those things and does it do them all well I was given a trial size of this moisturizer by bzzagent and Olay to try the product and review it so I decided to try it for 2 weeks and see if it really works and does all the things it claims. I started using the moisturizer every morning either after I washed my face or as soon as I got out of the shower. After about 4 days of using it every morning I noticed that my skin looked brighter, felt and looked more firm and my skin tone looked more even, and at that point I decided I was really starting to love the way this moisturizer was making my skin look and I knew I had to keep using it to see if it was going to start helping with the other 4 areas it claims to help with as well. A few days later, after about 7 days of use, I noticed that my skin looked and felt more moisturized then it used too and that the dry flakey skin I usually have around my nose, that no matter what I haven't been able to get rid, was no longer then and was actually moisturized now. After about a week and a half I noticed that my pores looked smaller and that I didn't have as many pimples as usual, which was a bonus for me because who likes to likes to have pimples, especially in their mid 20's. At this point I was in love with this moisturizer because it was doing more then I thought it would and making my skin look and feel great. I don't really have a lot of wrinkles or fine lines (I know we all like to think we have none) but I do have a few and this moisturizer helped reduce the look of them and made it so I couldn't even notice some of them anymore. I don't really have any age spots so I cant say how it works on them, but based on how it worked on all the other problems I have I have no doubt that it would work great on them as well. So does Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 anti aging moisturizer really work and work well at that I would have to say yes! And I am going to continue this routine and will recommend this moisturizer to anyone who asks or anyone looking for one to try.

("Okay so I have been using Olay Total Effects for a few months and can really see the difference in my skin. I have almost forgotten what my skin used to look like I had more visibly obvious fine lines and my pores were definitely more obvious. I was really surprised to look back at old pictures and see that I definitely have more fine lines around my eyes my pores were definitely more obvious and my general skintone was less even. I didn't think using Olay total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging moisturizer was really that much difference than all the other facial lotions that are on the market. I am so used to seeing commercial after commercial about different creams that claim to have all these extravagant benefits but after trying them they all seem to be the same, unlike Olay. I spent quite a bit of time over the holidays with friends and relatives that I have not seen it in a while almost all of them commented not only on how healthy and generally well that I looked but also that my skin seemed flawless and rejuvenated. As always, the first question that comes up is what have you been doing eating or not eating that has changed your appearance so much, and as I told all of them my new secret Olay. I told him all about the benefits of the reducing the size of my pores, removing the small fine lines, evening out my skin tone, and generally giving my skin a youthful glow. They all know I am a Bzz agent so of course there next question is do you have any free samples as I usually do when I am part of a campaign. They were very disappointed to know that I only got one bottle of this uber's special cream. I told them from my experience that I have seen this product go on sale fairly regularly and told them I will let them know next time I see it's on sale. So in closing, I will definitely continue to use Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging moisturizer, even if it is not on sale, which says a lot about me. So thank you again Bzz agent for letting me be a part of this fabulous campaign and once again trying a new product that I possibly wouldn't have purchased otherwise and am now a big fan.

("I started using anti aging treatment since i was 30 yo to ward off wrinkles and dull skin , I've tried other products and kept on trying because I haven't found the right one yet ,i am glad i got to try Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer .It came in a nice shape plastic bottle with a pump which is good because it pumped out small amount enough to cover your face and neck, no wastage compared to those ones in a bottle and cap where you pour too much or squeeze too much in a tube , or in a jar where you scoop lots and waste some. Olay Trial bottle contains 15 ml , not sure how long will it last but definitely i will continue using it as my everyday thing because of its visible results in just 4 days . On my first try , i pressed the pump halfway and get a good amount ,enough for my face and neck , i like this best because i can control the flow and decide just in case i need more, its consistency as i feel it on my finger feels even and smooth,it has a subtle fragrance just enough to make you feel clean and fresh,which i like because i dont want anything too smelly on my face. I applied it on my face down on my neck evenly using an ample amount and the first thing i notice is it doesn't leave a greasy feeling nor looking oily after awhile unlike my other moisturizer.I observed it on my face all day and there is no signs of oiliness at all , my face looks firm and i am even blushing all day , it feels smooth and i can feel the dryness and tightness disappear , the vitamin content is really working. I cant help staring at the mirror of every shop i went through as i went shopping that day , at this early i can see my face is glowing indeed and feels soft to touch. I also applied it before bedtime it feels like you are not wearing anything on your face at all , so light and when i wake up you can still feel the smoothness and i can see my pores closed which is another thing because of my type of skin .As i washed my face in the morning i didnt get any residue at all ,my pores are tightened , i was totally amazed as i notice my white heads are gone and my pores are minimized , I can say at this early that my skin feels firm ,even and moisturize. Fine lines under my eyes are less visible. This product works so well without leaving any signs skin irritation like itchiness and redness as it doesn't contain any harsh chemicals . It met my expectations so far ,Cant wait to share this to my friends and i will also recommend this to younger group because of its vitamin b complex content as it reduces facial oil and minimize formation of acne . I will post an update soon as i cant wait to see those fine lines under my eyes and age spots to totally disappear.

('In my first review I had only been using the Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer for about two weeks and the only improvement I thought I had seen, was the skin on my face and neck felt softer. How ever, there was more of an improvement to my facial skin than I first thought there had been in this short amount of time, I just hadnt noticed it myself. It took my sister in-laws to point out to me that the dark spots that had developed on my forehead from the summer sun had also disappeared. At first I didnt believe them and I had to get up and take a good look for myself, but sure enough they were all gone! Seeing this made my sister in-laws go out and each buy a bottle of Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer the minute they left my house and they tell me their both loving it and theyre both beginning to show improvements as well. As for myself, I still really like that you only need one pump of the bottle to get just the right amount out of it, thus youre not wasting any of the product. I love how quickly it blends into my skin and Im still pleased with how fast the little scent that it does have, fades away quickly. Aside from those wonderful aspects the thing that has sold me the most about this product are that it works! The little lines that were around my eyes and mouth arent near as noticeable as they had been at the beginning of this trail and from what I can tell the longer I use it, the more improvements Im achieving. I really cant say enough about how fast it was able to transform my skin from dull, dry looking and dotted with dark spots, into skin that looks and feels softer, is smoother and brighter and just over all refreshed looking! The question is, has using Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer for four weeks turned back the hands of time ten years Well Im not so sure about ten years, but it definitely has improved my facial skins over all appearance and Im extremely happy about that. Ill definitely continue to use Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer and with any kind of luck, those hands of time will also continue to fall back. How far they will fall and how fast is anyones guess, just as long as they keep going in the right direction Ill be happy to buy more Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer. Being able to do this trial has also convinced me to give more of the Olay products a try and I cant wait to see the results I hope to also have with them. Oh and Id also like to add that Ive heard back from well over half of the women Ive spoken with about Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer. They all have reported to me that they are also loving not only using the product, but loving the results they are all starting to achieve. Id like to thank BzzAgent and the makers of Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer for giving me the opportunity to try this wonderful product and for allowing me to inform others about it. Its been a pleasure, thank You! This review was collected as part of a promotion.', {'entities': [(45, 49, 'PRODUCT')]})
("I've been using Olay Total Effects 7-in-1 anti-aging moisturizer for a month now. I apply it in the morning and at night, after I have washed my face. Total Effects is an all-in-one anti-aging facial moisturizer that enhances one's own natural beauty by giving you younger, healthier-looking skin. I struggle with rosacea, eczema and psoriasis which often gives my skin the appearance of redness, blotchiness, roughness and a bumpy and uneven texture. Not only has Total Effects improved my fine lines, wrinkles, and age spots, but it has also diminished my skin's rough texture, dryness and scaliness. Even after having used this moisturizer for a relatively short time, my skin now looks hydrated, even toned with age spots fading. I actually developed a slight pink in my cheeks as opposed to uneven red blotches. It got rid of some red, itchy patches on my chin, forehead and the sides of my nose. It handles eczema and dryness really well. My undereye area has lightened and looks less puffy. It has a rich texture that glides on and seeps in without feeling sticky or tacky. My face feels firmer and my makeup doesn't settle in lines and creases. I'm very pleased with this product and how my skin has responded to it. Olay Total Effects 7-in-1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer works with a VitaNiacin complex and has fights the 7 signs of aging. This VitaNiacin formula, with Vitamins C and E exfoliate to enhance skin's natural self-renewal process for healthier looking skin in just 4 weeks. Although I have only used the moisturizer, Olay does have a complete line of anti-aging products to help you look anything but your age. In a nutshell, this is what Olay Total Effects can do for your skin: hydrate and diminish the appearance of fine lines, large pores, uneven texture, dryness, free radical damage, dullness and dark spots. Olay has a simple yet smart approach to achieve younger, healthier-looking skin they combine 7 benefits into 1 simple step to help keep skin look its youthful radiant best. Olay Total Effects 7-in-1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer promises to: 1. Visibly smoothes fine lines and wrinkles 2. Even skin tone appearance 3. Enhance brightness 4. Minimize the look of pores 5. Visibly reduce age spots 6. Restore firmness 7. Replenishe moisture In terms of how Olay Total Effects looks, smells and feels, this is what I found. It has a light floral scent that is pleasant yet subtle it has a soft, smooth, and non-oily/non-greasy feel that quickly and easily absorbs in the skin making skin feel super-moisturized right away it looks matte on skin when applied and makes skin look nourished and soft to the touch. Most importantly, Olay will not clog your pores. I'm very pleased with the results I've gotten from this moisturizer. I had previously been using an other anti-aging products with little or no visible improvement to my complexion. I was disheartened by spending money on beauty products and after months seeing MINIMAL results. Thankfully, I received a sample of Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer from BzzAgent to try and review. This is the best all-around anti-aging moisturizer I've ever used, truly targeting 7 skin aging problems. I recommend this product to anyone without reservation.

("There is nothing more exciting than opening up your mailbox to find you have a new BzzAgent box with a product to sample and review. The Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer arrived and certainly got me excited to try it! I was so excited to try it (and test it on my skin type) that I sampled a bit on the back of my hand first. Now, I will admit (Sigh) I'm gently approaching 40 and my hands are now less than perfect. I just had to give the cream a try somewhere, and my hands were just right there screaming out...help me! I was so impressed with just one application on my hand in comparison to my other hand I was almost tempted to do a trial on just my hand to show the difference! (But then I though...eeke....one hand would look soooo good and the other would still look so, well, spotted and older, best wait till I purchase a full size to correct that later on) I did use the sample size on my face and within a few days noticed my face seemed to be glowing, almost brighter. The texture of the cream is so smooth and goes on like velvet and has a pleasant light scent to it. With combination skin, this cream worked well for me as it didn't over do my oily areas or leave my dry areas in need. I can't say for sure in a week that my pores are any smaller, I will be able to tell more by following through with the purchase of a full size bottle. I can say that it was helping with the age spots on my hands (I know, I know...I'm reporting on my face...but whatever leftover cream I had I used from applying on my face I rubbed all over the back of my hands....let me tell you how fantastic it was to see a reduction on those ugly little spots! Whatever works right) My skin is feeling fresh and great with using the Olay total Effects 7 in 1 and I do recommend giving it a try if you are looking for a new face cream full of vitamins to help you fend off aging and age spots as well as uneven skin.

("BzzAgent offered to send me Pantene Pro-V shampoo and conditioner. I chose the Age Defy as the claim stated on the bottle is that it instantly restores youthful vitality. Sounded great, right When I received the bottle I noted that it stated 7 signs of aging hair: (1) breakage (2) split ends (3) frizz (4) unruly greys (5) lackluster colour (6) thin look (7) dryness My hair definitely suffers from breakage and split ends, and there are indeed a few unruly greys...perhaps a little more every day. The other issues weren't really a concern for me, but since it was sent to me for free I figured I'd give it a go. I was intrigued by the bottle. It didn't match it's shampoo sister. Instead of being tall and thin, it was almost conical, with the opening at the bottom. Very smart design as it allows the viscous product to settle down at the spout, and thus render it easier to squeeze out of the bottle. I also liked that the plastic was malleable, making it easy to dispense product. I was surprised that there was only 237mL of product in the condition, compared to the 285mL of shampoo since most folks tend to use more conditioner than shampoo. Like the shampoo, the conditioner has that typical Pantene scent, which I find pleasant and not overwhelming. It has a thick and creamy consistency which spreads easily over the hair strands, and combs through nicely withinthe shower. I always use both shampoo and conditioner so it is difficult to comment on how the conditioner works on its own. I can say that my hair felt silky smooth, which I suspect is due to the presence of silicone in the conditioner. My hair smelled great, but there wasn't any noticeable change. I still had breakage and I still had split ends, and my greys were just as unruly as they had been. All in all, I'm rating this conditioner 3 out of 5 starts. In my mind, it is pretty average. My hair felt smooth, but it became oddly subject to static electricity which I had not experienced prior. Like its shampoo sister, it left my hair smelling pleasant, but I hope most conditioners would do so.

It smells nice but not my favourite of scents because I'm not a huge fan of the smell of coconuts. It detangled my curly hair easily. After I blowed my hair I did notice that I had less fly away hairs and less frizz! I also noticed it tammed down my grey hairs, and my hair felt silky smooth!

("I think this is a very good conditioner. It comes out of the tube like a rich, creamy moisturizer and smells fantastic. I have been using Pantene products for years, but I have used this conditioner for about two weeks. For starters it is way thicker and more luxurious than other conditioners. Some conditioners are watery and runny. it lathers up really well and then washes out completely without leaving any residue that can weigh hair down. My biggest issues are aging hair, including unruly greys, lackluster dyed hair and dry hair. My hair is also naturally wavy and can get really frizzy, especially in the dry, cold Canadian winters. This conditioner addresses all these issues. My hair is soft and manageable and feels moisturized and well nourished. My scalp is not dry or itchy. My hair has a lot of bounce and movement in it. It is bright and shiny and healthy. It is now more like my 19 year old daughter's hair. I like this product and will continue to use it.

The scent is pleasant and light and not noticeable in my scent free workplace. I believe that this product can Defy age as well as the environment, heated hair appliances and all the rough stuff that life throws at our hair.

("Pantene Expert Pro-V Age Defy Shampoo and Conditioner Thanks to BzzAgent and Pantene, Im trying this product for free!! First impressions mean everything! When I opened up my kit I immediately noticed the new sleeker bottle design. The slender black bottle has a no-fuss appeal and a higher end look and feel to it. Next came the scentAMAZING! It has an expensive salon smell, definitely not what I'd expect from a product you can buy at the drugstore. I have very thick long curly hair and finding a shampoo and conditioner that works for me is tough, to say the least. Lately, my hair has been showing the tell-tale signs of aging, dry, brittle, breakage, split ends, pesky gray hairs that pop up and scream 'YOOHOO, LOOK AT ME!' and, of course, dreaded FRIZZ. The biggest issues for me are all of the above so I was excited about trying out a product that claimed to be concocted to tackle all of my hair woes. So lets do it!! I've used this product for a little more than two weeks now and so far I'm thrilled. The shampoo has a thick and lasting lather. I could almost feel my hair getting thicker as I worked the lather through my hair. I was anxious to see how the conditioner would stack up. The thick creamy consistency is exactly what you want out of a conditioner. I worked the thick cream through my tangled mass of curls and then I waited a few minutes before rinsing. Wow! Huge impact! Manageable and easy to untangle, my hair looks and feels so soft and silky and the breakage issue is well on its way to being non-existent. Then theres the gray hair issue, they are now blended into my hair and not sticking up. I actually had to look for graysso much less noticeable! Damaged aging hair is no longer the first thing I see in the mirror. I would highly recommend it to friends and family and I will definitely continue using Pantene Pro-V Age Defy.

You can visibly see the differences as well - my hair doesn't have those frizzies it's healthier looking (has a beautiful shine). I'm really impressed!

Lathered shampoo into hair and the amount was plenty enough for my head. It rinsed out so clean, it actually squeaked! Next I used the conditioner, same amount as I used with the shampoo which was plenty enough to saturate my hair and scalp. After rinsing all the conditioner out, wrapped hair in towel to soak up excess water! After removing towel and towel dried hair I looked at hair it looked so shiny. It felt so clean and light! Most conditioners don't rinse out clean and your hair feels heavy and afterwards my hair looks greasy! Brushing it was so easy, so smooth and silky! No knots to fight with and loosing a handful of hair. I blow dried my hair and OMG, it felt even lighter! Wasn't sure if I had hair on my head! LOL! It was light and fluffy.

It has helped my hair to regain the shine, tame the fly aways, and help with the split ends, breakage, and to make my hair look fuller. Now what I did find with this conditioner is if I didn't use it every day my hair was built up with static. I like to be able to use conditioner every other day or every two days. So this was a bit of a disappointment to me that I would get static in my hair because I didn't use the conditioner.

As I had reported in my review of the matching shampoo (Age Defy), I was a little hesitant at first to use this line as I did not have good experiences with some of Pantene's other shampoos and conditioners. I found some of Pantene's other conditioners to have too strong a scent (and not a pleasant scent in my opinion), as well as weighing my hair down. Just like it's matching shampoo, the Age Defy conditioner had a pleasant smell that was not strong at all. With my fine hair, the conditioner gave my hair some nice volume and bounce.

A lot of other conditioners end up running down my face (yikes) or drips into my eyes (ouch) or completely rinsing out of my hair without me ever touching it (boo). Not this stuff. It smells phenomenal, and is soooooo silky. It makes a big difference in blow drying my hair too. I have fine, dry, broken hair.

('This movie combines so many different elements that it\'s hard to review them all at once. First, there\'s the central character\'s drama. After he\'s gotten good and used to the adulation his racing career brings, it has to stop. A \'medical\' condition threatens to kill him if he pursues that 110% lifestyle. So, he sets his sights elsewhere - not lower (as he was to find), but elsewhere, and among others, each with a past of their own.Then there\'s a "little engine that could" subtext, with plenty of setbacks. There\'s also the inspiring thought that a hero doesn\'t need to be a hero to anyone, or even known to be heroic. ("How do I get my picture on that wall?") There\'s more in that thought that I realized at first, the notion of being your own hero, and a real one, not just an ego-fantasy. Also, self-worth through achievement instead of an entitled feel-goodism, and seeing many contributors making very different contributions, and the snarky sense of comeuppance when that self-serving bureaucrat gets his mud-flaps pinned back, it all adds up to a healthy view of what a truly good life can be, in terms kids can grasp.But John Lassiter produced this and that\'s as good as a promise signed, sworn, and notarized saying you\'ll get technical excellence welded to warm characterization. Go back to his 1986 \'Luxo Jr,\' and give that talent thirty years to mature - that\'s what you\'ll see here.

('What\'s the point? That\'s the question director Jon Favreau and the brass at Disney had to answer if they were going to justify the money and man hours required to bring the visually stunning "live action" version of Rudyard Kipling\'s The Jungle Book to the big screen some fifty years after the Disney animated version taught generations upon generations of children the bare necessities of life. What would be the point of retelling this story to the current generation in an updated form? What more could they bring to it that children might not elicit from that 1967 original? In short, would there be more of a point to it than simply showing off the technical wizardry of Weta Digital and their visual effects work? The funny thing is, we more than likely remember the 1967 version through nostalgia-filled eyes that cloud our judgment of the actual film. In going back and watching that film-the one I very much enjoyed as a child despite being born in the late eighties-it quickly became apparent there wasn\'t much substance to the story and that the film was more a collection of little scenes filled with different, but interesting animal personalities that featured catchy songs written by the Sherman brothers and very little more until Shere Khan showed up at the end to create some type of tension. And so, going into this latest version of Kipling\'s story that would pull from both that source material while being heavily inspired by the \'67 film the biggest improvement they could make would be in the story department by crafting a narrative that held a driving force with serious forward momentum and a throughline plot that, at the very least, would add a little more significance and reason to seeing the film in the first place. With screenwriter Justin Marks (whose only prior feature credits include a Street Fighter film and a TV movie) though, we are brought the one thing I couldn\'t even have imagined to add and that was a cohesion to the thinly connected events of the original animated movie. Giving purpose and connection that take Mowgli (Neel Sethi) from point A to point B lends the film a real ambition making the stunning visuals only more of an achievement.', {'entities': [(76, 82, 'PRODUCT')]})

I have very dry blonde curly hair, not thick but a lot of hair. This shampoo is excellent. does not dry out my hair.. leaves it clean. Wish it had the fresh scent of the split ends formula though. No matter though, it's great and I recommend it for those who have very dry hair.The conditioner is excellent! Detangles without too much help of a comb! Hair looks soft and shiny even after it's dry:) other shampoos(dove,Neutrogena triple moisture, Tressemme worked well in the beginning then my hair would feel like hay and it would feel sticky.Thank you... Now Alberto VO5 please remove the sodium lauryl sulfate in the shampoos that are color treated,that need moisture and I guarantee people will never say ..it dries my hair out.. Been using it for a week now.. And I'm in love with this! do not stop making it though!!", {'entities': [(19, 30, 'PRODUCT')]})
("I see what Warner Brothers Animation is attempting to do here and I can dig it. After finding great success with The LEGO Movie and the fact they acquired the likes of Phil Lord and Chris Miller who directed 21 and 22 Jump Street (as well as Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs, to their credit) to helm that hit animated movie the thought of continuing to try their hand at bringing in R-rated comedy directors and seeing how they operate within the world of childrens entertainment is a ballsy, but interesting move. Much like with the case of The LEGO Movie Warner Bros. was likely hoping this formula might produce something both mature and goofy with the plus of remaining consistently funny throughout the majority of its runtime. It makes sense and what better way to test said formula than with the likes of Nicolas Stoller, director of such films as Forgetting Sarah Marshall and the two Neighbors movies, thus the reason we now have Storks. Because of this inclination to take someone known for one thing and put them just far enough outside of their element, their comfort zone if you will, I was inclined to be more interested in this seemingly agreeable animated family movie than I might have been otherwise. I love it when directors or studios cast an actor known for one type or style of work, especially comedians, and place them in a different setting where we see them challenged in new/different ways that usually result in a more fascinating piece of work by virtue of the outside influences and persona that performer brings with them. That is kind of what is happening here though maybe not to the extreme of, say, Jim Carrey in The Truman Show. Rather, Stoller is being challenged by the limits of a PG-rating and how far he can go with his comedy inadvertently forcing him to be more creative with how he comes up with the laughs needed for a 90-minute children's film. And so, how does all of this hype and build-up effect the final product? Well, in many ways this is a disappointment when considering the potential the film had considering the interesting premise, its insanely talented and funny voice cast, and of course the presence of Stoller in the director's chair. Instead of producing anything unique or of distinguishable value Storks more or less plays by the rules of Pixar and DreamWorks movies where the narrative sees a couple of characters going on a quest to achieve a goal that will allow them to discover new things about themselves along the way. There's nothing especially wrong with this structure especially when executed in fun and interesting ways and Storks certainly has its quirks, but more than anything the film feels far too routine to be a product of someone who should have really been challenging themselves.", {'entities': [(560, 572, 'PRODUCT')]})

("Progresso had a Meatball and Rice soup last year (2015) that Target carried in the Bay Area and I loved it, kept going back to purchase larger and larger quantities when I ran out. Then the weather got hot and I stopped buying soup. With winter again, I wanted that soup and couldn't find it anywhere. I was so happy when I found that Target.com had it and purchased more than a dozen cans. Much to my surprise, it's not the same recipe! The soup I had last year was tomato based and only had meatballs. This soup is also tomato based, I think. I couldn't quite tell because of how much oregano was in it. And it had chunks of chicken and bits of corn. It tastes so different from the soup from last year! I've decided to donate the rest of my cans to a food bank for the holidays and hope that someone else will like it more than me. Target.com had great prices and the delivery was incredibly fast. The cans of soup were wrapped in heavy duty plastic bags, somewhat wasteful but definitely helpful to prevent spills should any cans unexpectedly get punctured or damaged, although none were damaged. Too bad the plastic bags had some tiny holes in them, otherwise I could have put them to other uses as pet waste pick-up, oh well. So, overall, the soup was a disappointment but the buying experience was good.", {'entities': [(0, 9, 'PRODUCT')]})
