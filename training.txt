("To me this rice is so different than my regular rice (long grain brown) that I think of it as a different grain. Yes, the aroma is interesting I'd say it takes a bit of getting used to. I really enjoy the size and texture of the cooked grains. After trying the Wehani by itself, I began cooking 1/3 Wehani, 1/3 Lundberg Brown Basmati and 1/3 either brown rice store brand or Wang sweet brown rice that I get at an Asian supermarket. I always saute the rice in a bit of vegetable oil 'til it is browned, before adding the liquid. This combo and browning seems to develop the nutty flavor that I favor. However, I've found that when browning the rice, not to overdo it because if the rice gets too roasted it will no longer cook normally - apparently it loses its ability to absorb water. Then you get the crunchies.I do find that Wehani takes considerably longer to fully absorb the water. I use the regular 2:1 ratio, water to rice (plus salt). It is my practice to bring it to a rolling boil, then reduce the heat to a simmer for 2 hours. It just means planning ahead a bit further.Often I cook meat at the same time in the same pot, starting both together so the rice will gain the flavoring of the meat juices. When I do that, I adjust the other liquid downward. The one alert I'd post is that the strong coloring of the rice stains the meat, especially when using the Wehani alone. Doesn't bother me, but you might want to know this will happen.Chilled cooked Wehani rice makes a fine salad with the addition of minced garlic, fresh ginger root pared then diced, finely sliced scallions, chopped fresh parsley and Chinese five-spice.

("From all I have ever been able to learn, Lundberg is a first class operation. I have tried (I think) every rice and rice blend that they offer, over the years that I have been buying their products. While I didn't always care for a particular variety, it was never an issue of quality, just a matter of personal preference.There is one problem, which is not Lundberg's fault, but is worth noting. Too often, in local grocery stores, the Lundberg product does not turn over fast enough to avoid a decline in quality. I assume it is caused by a fermentation of the whole grain (not a problem with lesser rices because much of the good stuff is removed). The symptoms are a bag which is swollen, and rice which tastes a bit like Play-Doh smells. Play-Doh 24 Pack of Colors In order to avoid this problem, I started ordering my Lundberg on-line, and storing the extra bags in my freezer or refrigerator until used. So, buying it here (which is a little cheaper than Lundberg's on-line store) is a good way to go. If you want to buy just one bag to try at your local grocery store, check the bag carefully, and if it tastes like Play-Doh when you get home with it, that bag was too old.Of all the Lundberg products, Countrywild is my absolute favorite. It is a nice blend of flavors, and I sometimes eat a bowl of it for my entire meal. It has a good flavor to it, but it is not as intense as some of the other varieties.One more thing. For years I was frustrated with obtaining a good result when cooking whole grain rice. I finally tried a pressure rice cooker instead of the more common non-pressure methods. It really made a huge difference, and if you are a rice lover, you may want to try something like this Sanyo ECJ-PX50S 5-Cup Micro-Computerized Pressure Rice Cooker and Steamer or if your budget can stand it, Zojirushi NP-HTC18 Induction Heating 10-Cup Pressure Rice Cooker and Warmer(I use the Sanyo and like it pretty well.

When I was selected to test Olay Total Effects Anti Aging Moisturizer I was filled with great expectations, hoping that this moisturizer would be another amazing discovery. When my product sample arrived I was quite disappointed because I was sent a sample that was way too light for my skin tone. I do not know how this happened because I selected the darkest shade in the pre-selection survey.

("I was twittering with excitement to try Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer from the moment I heard about it. My skin has begun to show signs of aging and with my upcoming wedding I was trying to look and feel my very best. An age spot or two have emerged and the fine lines were beginning to deepen. These were high on the lists of this new product. My super sensitive skin was generally okay with Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer, no small feat. Each day I would wash my skin and apply the product, waiting anxiously for the promised results...and each day I was disappointed. I was hesitant to write this review as I like Olay's products and love being a BzzAgent but I do believe in honesty. I was so disappointed in this product and the lack of Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer's claims to be true that I must give it a 0 out of 5, if I could. After a couple of weeks, it started to cause some small pimples, dry spots and redness. I would actually recommend that people not use this product.

I like the packaging, the texture, and even the smell, but the product made my skin blotchy, and my forehead erupted in many raised pimple-like bumps! My slightly uneven skin tone looked worse than usual, but as soon as I stopped using the moisturizer, my skin went back to normal the next day. No more blotchiness, or bumpy pimply things. I did not BZZ about this product because of my negative experience with it, and I threw out the rest of the Olay moisturizer.

("This is the first time I have been disappointed with a product that I have tested for Bzzagent, so I'm not even sure where to begin. I just cannot say that I would buy the Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer. I gave it one star to represent the first day I used this product. I was fairly happy, but as time went on, I became more and more disappointed, and eventually stopped using it. I didn't even get through the whole sample that was sent to me. Now, I guess I should describe my skin type, because maybe that is part of the reason I did not enjoy this product. I have very fair skin, and I tend to get very rosy cheeks, so I need a skin-calming moisturizer to reduce redness. I also have sensitive skin, which is dry in parts. I rarely get acne, but my skin easily becomes dry. I have some fine lines around my eyes which bother me a bit, but they aren't that bad. A bigger issue is puffiness around my eyes. The first day I tried the Olay 7 in one moisturizer, I was pleased by its consistency and the scent wasn't bad. I believe it has the classic Olay scent that I remember from my mom's Oil of Olay that she used when I was a child. If not, it is close. It absorbed really well too! My skin felt great, and not greasy at all. Unfortunately, after using the Olay 7 in 1 for three days, I noticed my rosy cheeks starting to become worse and worse. I'm not sure whether this product has sunscreen in it, and sunscreen is a huge factor in my choice of moisturizer. Whether it was from the fact that there is no sunscreen in this one, or a reaction, my cheeks kept getting redder and redder. I don't enjoy wearing a lot of make up on a daily basis, but it started getting so bad that I had to start covering it up with concealer and powder. Then I noticed my nose becoming shinier every day, so I had to wear more make up. Finally, I noticed a pimple on my nose. This was the last straw. I stopped using the moisturizer and switched back to my usual one, and in a few days these issues with my skin went away again. So, to sum up, this moisturizer did not work for me. It's definitely worth a try, but I am pretty particular about my skin because I really don't like to cover up with make up. I'd much rather have a calm, clear complexion in the first place. I would consider trying it again if in fact one with sunscreen included came on the market, but I'm not even certain if that would be enough.

("I held off on giving my review because I wanted to make sure that I gave this product a good enough chance so I could do a good review. I was excited to receive this to try out. I was very hopeful that it would do what it claimed to do. Olay is a well known brand and I was positive that it would do wonders for my skin. My skin is starting to show fine lines and my laugh lines are getting deeper. My hopes with using this product was that it would decrease the fine lines and give me a more brighter complexion while moisturizing my skin. As I get older I find that my skin is getting more dry and I was looking for something that would hydrate my skin all day. When I first got this sample I used it for 2 days before my skin broke out. I didn't think that it was the olay so I continued to use it for several more days. I suffer from nodulocystic acne so after a couple days of using olay, the flare up of my acne was not getting better so I had to discontinue using the product. I decided that I would let my face clear up before I would try a second time to see if it was in fact the olay. Going back to trying it out though, I did notice a couple things. I felt that a little did not go a long way with olay. I had to use more then I thought I should have to get coverage. I found that it was not as thick as other moisturizers that I had tried so it was alarming to me that I had to use so much. I did like the smell of it though. It has a nice pleasant smell. Getting back to my second try of the olay. My face had cleared up after about a week and a half so I decided to try olay again. Within 1 day my face broke out in the cystic acne and I was back at square one. I was very unhappy that it broke my face out with huge acne again. I had to discontinue the product.

("Having used various formulations of Olay for the past 20 years I was really excited to try this new product. I have combination skin with some dry patches, ageing skin and occasionally a dash of dehydration. To qualify my review I think I need explain how I introduce a new skin care product to my regimen. I keep everything the same except for 1 product and I use it for a minimum of 2 weeks before I keep it in my routine. Experience has shown me that I will most often either see the beginning of benefits or any complications in that time. I approached the Total Effects in the same manner - it was the only product that I changed. I wasn't really worried, as I said, Olay products were a known entity. On the first few uses I noticed similar attributes - a distinctive scent, texture and how it applied. After about 4 days I noticed a change in my skin - namely more breakouts and red splotches. Which I found odd because pimples are not a problem I usually experience. Hormones Nope. Change in activities Nope. Other life changes Nope. Skin regime Huh... So I stopped using Olay for a couple of days to see if the skin continued to get worst or resolve itself. The red splotches disappeared and the zits started to recede. After about 5 days I decided to try it again - unfortunately the red splotches returned and I had to discontinue using the product. I hesitate to condemn the product - skin is a temperamental devil and I liked many aspects of the product - it's very emollient, the scent while fairly strong is not offensive. Unfortunately I can't tell you about the positive effects as I couldn't use it long enough to give a fair review.

("upon receipt of my Olay Total Effects 7 in one package, I must say at the onset I was juxtaposed by the trial size. Not because I'm greedy, but because I immediately wondered how much to use, what is the right amount how do I employ this properly to be able to successfully report on my degree of satisfaction (or not). That aside, I enjoyed opening up the package, and always find Olay products to be sleek and silky in their packaging nature. I put a dollop on my finger and began to apply (after cleansing my face properly, of course). The texture was ...silky and smooth. It was lovely. I saw the commercial on TV which reported healthier-looking skin in 4 weeks (I think - that is what I recall). With a tester, I'm not sure I can evaluate that claim - and apologies if I got it wrong, that is what I remember from the ad. I think the claim of 7 benefits is complicated for consumers. I can't tell you what those 7 benefits are and I'm reading the packaging of the product I received right now. I think to simplify for consumers is helpful and appreciated. Finally - no SPF. that's a big one for me. of all the benefits there is no SPF protection. The packaging doesn't specifically call out (that I can see or understand) that this product is to be used as a night routine. It also doesn't suggest that an SPF is required after application. With all the fears and media reports on skin cancer this is a big one for me. So all in all I maintain my overall favorability to Olay, but I'm not sure I'd go out and buy this product given my needs and likes.

(I'm not sure why they sent such a small sample as their claims say that skin can look younger in 4 weeks, but they certainly didn't send enough to assess that claim.) The seven benefits noted on the product packaging are: (1) visibly smooths fine lines and wrinkles, (2) evens skin tone appearance, (3) enhances brightness, (4) minimizes the look of pores, (5) visibly reduces age spots, (6) restores firmness, and (7) replenishes moisture. My fine lines are (thankfully) still at a minimum, but I didn't note any change. My skin tone is pretty even, with the exception of my rosacea, but I've been using products from Batty's Bath which have done lovely things for my skin so I don't think the Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer have really contributed anything to that in a week's time.

I had high hopes when I received the Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 anti-aging moisturizer sample, and started using it the day it arrived. The main feature I was excited about was the vitamin complex that's meant to help fight seven signs of aging, as I've noticed a few fine lines starting to creep in around my eyes.

("I've been using the Olay total effects 7 in 1 anti aging moisturizer for a week now. I use it at night only because this does not have SPF contents. I've read that after applying anti-aging skincare it is very important to apply sunscreen on top, so instead of applying this plus sunscreen on top in the morning, I just use it at night. I believe this comes with an SPF version, which I would consider using in the morning. After a week of use so far, I have not noticed much anti-aging effects from it yet. Don't seem to see minimizing of wrinkles or fine lines, I have very deep laugh lines which I focus anti-aging products on, but I haven't seen any improvements yet. I like the container it comes in, which is a bottle with a nozzle so the product is not exposed to air as opposed to being in a jar. The disadvantage of that though is you cannot use the last bits of the product. The moisturizing aspect of this product is good, I apply it at night and when I wake up my skin does feel softer and not dry, more importantly it does not make my skin all oily when I wake up. Some night creams that I use will make my skin very oily the next morning, but this one did not, which I really liked, and it did not cause any outbreaks.

I didn't think it was the Olay because it had been fine for a few days. But I tried everything else I could think of before I stopped using it and within two days my skin had cleared.

I normally use olay 2 in 1 day cream and serum, and it goes on light and absorbs easily. it also smells nice. by comparison, olay total effects 7 in one is thick, stinks like a gramma, and doesn't seem to absorb at all, it sits on my face feeling thick and greasy. i'm not in love after the first week.

("Olay has been a leading name in skincare for decades. While I was eager to try this product to test its benefits, the very first interaction I had with it stunned me. Upon receiving the box, I read the ingredients. This moisturizer is based entirely with alcohol. Alcohol can provide a quick drying, non-greasy finish but it also zaps your skin's natural moisture, creating the need for you to use more of the product. I decided to try and put that out of my mind and try this product anyway. It is a pleasantly not too heavy lotion that I used every day for two weeks morning and night. Indeed, the lotion sinks into skin and quickly disappears. I did not experience any residual flaking indicating that my skin was not becoming more dry after use. However, in order to maintain the moisture level regular use gave me, I simply have to keep using the product. Other products I've used tend to help my skin maintain its own moisture and I can use the products as-needed. This product requires regular use again, this is a side effect of the alcohol. While this moisturizer gave me a lovely soft feeling after use and it was not unpleasant to use, I simply would prefer to have a product that would not perpetuate itself in my regimen. Perhaps if Olay is able to change their formula, I would be willing to try it again. This review was collected as part of a promotion.", {'entities': [(0, 4, 'PRODUCT')]})

After using the product for several weeks I didn't notice a difference in the lines or age spots on my face and my skin certainly didn't look 10 years younger. I found the product to feel oily on my skin and didn't overly like the feel. The one positive was that it wasn't overly scented.

The texture of the moisturizer is nice and creamy, but doesn't live up to its claims, at least for my skin type. I have to stick with my usual brands that don't contain any fragrance.

It was the perfect size as it allowed me enough time and product in order to assess all of its claims. The cream is a very smooth almost silky texture and is easy to apply evenly. You need to know your skin though and avoid putting this on your oilyest areas. It was almost like it was too moisturizing for my skin! I started breaking out again like I was a teenager. I thought this would pass the longer I used the product but unfortunately it did not. As far as reducing fine lines and wrinkles, it helped a little around the mouth but my forehead lines remained quite pronounced. It did a very good job at reducing the appearance of dark spots though I have hyper pigmentation on my cheeks and this definitely helped reduce the appearance of the brown spots and help even out my skin tone. Overall, I think if you have very dry skin this product may help with moisturizing and keeping your skin tone even, but I would give it a pass on the anti wrinkle claim. I also wouldn't buy this product again because I do not want to relive the pimple face look of my teen years. I returned to using the Olay Regenerist line and my comexion has cleared up.

I then asked my husband, my mother and a friend which side of my face looked better... and they did not see any difference. To be honest, I could not see the difference neither. So no miracle here, the 7 in 1 cream was not anti-aging. Still, it was a good moisturizer. I really liked the smooth texture and how it leaves my skin soft.

I started to get rashes, swollen, redness and dry patches after one week of use. After that I have discontinued use.

Maybe you will have better results I am sure it is worth to try, especially if you do not have any acne and if your skin is not too sensitive.

I actually love the size of the trial product because it is small and you will use it up in less time which means all the active ingredients would not have been exposed to the air for as long as it would take to use up a full size bottle.

("Well, I've given Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti Aging Moisturizer a very good go. Everyday so far (except today). What are the good points and the bad points PROS: Smells nice, feels luxurious on the skin when first applied, good consistency, not greasy. NEGATIVES: It leaves a white film on your skin if you happen to rub your face a minute after you've placed it on. This is true even on newly scrubbed skin that has no dead skin left on it so it isn't dead skin. Also, I think this actually made my fine lines stick out MORE. Before I tried this product, I hardly had any fine lines. I had great skin. I used to use my regular moisturizer and was very happy with it, this cream seemed to accentuate the fine lines around my eyes. I've not used the product in the last 2 days and voila! my skin looks great again, no fine lines around my eyes. This is all hype without much substance unfortunately. Would never recommend!

("I think Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 has some pretty high claims so I was pretty excited to try the sample size cream. I did notice upon opening the cream that there was a slight scent to the cream. The texture is very light and it doesn't feel greasy on the skin. It does make the skin feel smoother and it does seem to hold moisture in the skin. After a couple of uses the skin around my eyes started to get itchy. And after two more uses it got worse, so I knew right away it was the cream. I kept on using the cream and avoided getting close to my eyes at all, which I find such a pain. I didn't notice any difference in my fine lines or sun spots. The only thing I liked was the way it made my skin feel. I have now had to stop using the cream because any residual cream that I may have had on my fingers would irritate the skin around my eyes if I was rubbing them at all. I really wish this cream were scent free and hypoallergenic. I wouldn't recommend this for anyone with sensitive skin.

("Well I was given a sample of the Olay total effects 7 in 1 anti aging moisturizer to try in exchange for my honest review. Well, I just celebrated that certain birthday that some would say would make me over the hill. Do I have fine lines yes, but earned every one of them so when some product claims to fight fine lines and other things, I'll give it a try. Firstly, it's in a really cute and easy to handle package. It's supposed to be a 4 week sample amount but I doubt it. My skin is dry so it soaks it right up. Which brings up one really great aspect of the product....its doesn't burn my skin like other non hypoallergenic moisturizers do. I have been using the product for almost 3 weeks now and other than a great moisturizer, I have to say its not anti aging anything. Would i recommend this product I guess that is ultimately going to depend on what the price will be when I head to the drug store . Its a great moisturizer but nothing else.

("I enjoyed trying out the new anti-aging moisturizer from Olay but unfortunately I didn't see all the effects this 7-in-1 promised. I have been using it daily for 4 weeks every morning before I apply makeup, and sometimes at night before bed. It comes in an easy pump container and applied very smoothly and absorbed quickly into the skin. It left a matte finish and had no oily characteristics at all. It has a very faint moisturizer scent, but is less noticeable than other Olay products I've tried (I like scented products). Of the seven benefits listed the one I did find it succeeded in was the moisturization. It's a very good facial moisturizer and does so without being greasy or oily throughout the day. I was happy to be able to apply it under makeup without problems. It prevented dryness and flaky skin that I can get a lot in the winter. When it comes to the evens skin toneclaim, it was successful in just providing an oil-less matte finish. But this is just to say it looks like my natural skin and that there's no product on it. It didn't even out my complexion though. Now sadly the other 5 signs of aging continued with me. I saw no difference in my fine lines, wrinkles, and crow's feet. And I was surprised that it didn't enhance brightness. I've used a lot of Olay products that did have beautiful microscopic shimmers/illuminations in the moisturizers and this one had none. It didn't brighten at all. My pores were also the same large size I can see them without a magnifying mirror. I don't feel it made my face any firmer either. I have the same amount of elasticity and softness as before. I was really looking forward to seeing a difference in my age spots. I do use an ineffective age spot treatment nightly dabbed onto these spots and have used this for a year with not lightening. My point is that every night I use a magnifying mirror to examine them and after 4 weeks of using this Olay Total Effects product they are all still accounted for and the same size and darkness. I really wish they would go away. So overall I have no difference in appearance to my face and its flaws and therefore do not look visibly younger. It is a nice facial moisturizer suitable for both morning and evening application, but that is as far as I can recommend it.

("I received my Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer. Eventhough I am often mistaken for looking much younger than I really am, I have noticed some progressive signs of aging on my face in the last couple of years. As such, I was was very excited to try this moisturizer out. I have been looking for an alternative moisturizer to combat some fine lines that have begun to form on my face - largely on my forehead between my eyebrows as well as below my eyes around my upper cheek area. The other reason I was excited to try this moisturizer was to combat some of my other problem areas: I have uneven skin tone that appears dull without makeup and I have large pores that are difficult to mask even with foundation. I also have very oily skin but combined with dry patches when I don't properly moisturize. The Olay Total Effects packaging was very nice looking and I was able to open the packaging easily. Due to my sensitive skin and allergies to certain chemicals found in many beauty and makeup products, I instantly scrutinized the list of ingredients. Fortunately none of the ingredients listed matched the small list of chemicals I am known to be allergic to. My next step was to pump some of the product onto my hand to do a a patch test on my wrist. The pump easily dispensed a small dollop of product and I found it quite easy to control the amount that was dispensed. Next I proceeded to do a smell test as I generally do not prefer any strong perfumes or smells to be applied to my skin. I found that the smell was gentle and not overpowering at all - just a hint of floral-like scent that didn't linger whatsover. Next I applied some of the moisturizer to the inside of my wrist. The moisturizer glided on smoothly and absorbed into my skin without leaving any residue or oily feeling. This was a huge plus for me. I repeated this patch test over the course of a week to ensure no hives or rashes. Finally I felt confident enough to apply the product to my face. This was done nightly right after cleansing my face. The moisturizer seemed to absorb easily into my skin and generally didn't leave an oily appearance. It also seemed to moisturize the skin. However this is pretty much where the PROS of this product stops. After repeatedly applying the moisturizer to my face every night, I did not notice any change in my skin. In fact, I noticed dry flakey patches the next morning where I had applied the moisturizer. This was very disappointing to see - especially since my regular moisturizer never left flakey patches. Another great disappointment is that the moisturizer did nothing to smooth out my fine lines and forehead wrinkles. There was absolutely no improvement. My pores were still largely visible and my skin tone no brighter. All in all, I had high hopes for Olay Total Effects but the moisturizer did not seem to have any effect on my skin. Perhaps the formulation and/or the ingredients is not what my skin needs. This review was collected as part of a promotion.", {'entities': [(14, 18, 'PRODUCT')]})

("I just received the lastest BzzAgent campaign for Olay Total Effects and am excited although skeptical to try this product. Being in my 40's now, and recently becoming a grandma, I'm starting to try to recapture my youth. Let's face it I'd rather not look my age. I'm beginning to notice some fine lines around my eyes, the evidence of age-spots and blotchy looking skin. Over the years I've tried numerous products that claim they address similar issues and to say I was disappointed would be an understatement. When I opened my BzzAgent campaign, my first impression was wow, that bottle sure is cute but very, very tiny. If I've learned anything from being a BzzAgent is that unless you try it don't always go on first impressions. So being the objective person I am, I'm going to include Olay Total Effects into my daily regime. Yesterday was day 1, after showering I performed my usual facial cleansing, exfoliating followed by Olay Total Effects. It took but a moment to realize that the reason that the bottle is so tiny is because you really don't need as much product as you'd think. It completely saturated into my skin, leaving it feeling velvety (If that's a word) and not greasy as most products tend to leave my skin. I have not yet noticed a visual difference, but am impressed with the feel of my skin and a very light scent. I've found that the products I've tried can tend to smell like medicine, but this is very subtle. I feel confident that if I use this product daily within a week I should notice some differences, so I'll be checking back in with updates. I'm really hoping that this product does what it claims, to have people say wow, I can't believe your a grandma, look at your skin, would be the ultimate compliment.

('Olay Total Effects 7 in One Anti-aging Moisturizer I was excited to receive this sample because theres nothing I love more than trying new skin creams and am always looking for the *Hail Mary* product at a lower price point than skin care I currently use. Upon first application, my skin felt hydrated and plump, maintaining that feeling for hours. Unfortunately, during those few hours, I developed a rash and the next day a cystic pimple emerged on my chin. My skin can tolerate a lot without ever experiencing a rash but I do have issues with spots of acne following test drives with new products. This just happens to be one of those offenders. I always give products a second and even third chance in case a reaction is simply coincidence so a week later, I gave it another go with same results. Third time was also a bust. Because I couldnt use the product daily, I cant comment on most of the issues this product claims to address. I dont know specifically which ingredients make my skin break out. I do know that typically, any breakout I experience is usually related to products containing parabens or sunscreen. I understand that many products on the market require parabens to stabilize the product. Aside from the suspect paraben related outbreaks, I am also a breast cancer survivor and sensibility dictates that I cannot dismiss the potential association that is often made with relation to paraben content in our day to day skin care products and health issues. When theres more than one paraben involved, its a bigger concern. Stars added for the nourishing feel of the cream, subtracted for paraben content and puzzling rash.

("Olay is not a new brand, infact it has been around for many many years. My Great-Gran swore by Oil of Olay moisturizer. When this popped up on my BzzAgent list, I knew I had to give it a try. Now, I wouldn't say I'm old enough to have this moisturizer targeted towards my age group - but it never hurts to prevent or start a regime that will help my skin in the future. You're never too young to start. First off, I was a little surprised at how small this size was, and such bold claims it made! Younger looking skin in less than four weeks! How! This product claims to visibly smooth fine lines and wrinkles, even skin tone, enhance brightness, minimize the look of pores, visibly reduce age spots, restore firmness and replenish moisture. Smooth on clean face and neck, for best results use daily. This has your typical Olay scent. I'm not really a fan of scented facial products just because I have sensitive skin and I never know what is going to burn when I use it, or make my skin more dry. One pump is more than enough to cover your full face. It just soaks into your skin immediately and provides an instant rush of hydration. It dries somewhat matte. I didn't have a chance to try makeup on top of it, but I have a feeling it wouldn't work for me. I think this moisturizer would be good for someone with normal to lightly oily skin. I don't find that it is hydrating enough for my dry skin, because after about half an hour, my skin feels like it needs more moisture. I prefer a thicker cream, especially now that it is winter.

("I received the Olay Total Effects 7 in One Anti-Aging Moisturizer and was excited to try it as I work in retail and we carry the Olay Total Effects line. I have used Olay products in the past and liked how they worked with my skin, so being able to try a new item before it hits the market was great. I am at an in-between age, where my skin had begun to age but not yet displaying many fine lines or wrinkles. That said, the anti-aging properties did not do much for me. I did notice that my pores were visibly smaller, which was great for me as that is a major issue with my skin. My skin tone did have a more even apperance, but I did not notice much in terms of providing any brightness to my skin. The fragrance-free factor was much appreciated as many facial products are overloaded with heavy, unnecessary perfumes. I did find that the moisturizer provided an initial feeling of hydration to the skin, but halfway through the day after an application of makeup, I found the cream was not enough to provide me with sufficient moisture throughout the day. My skin would crack and peel in spite of heavy application of the Olay Total Effects 7 in One Anti-Aging Moisturizer both day and night. Perhaps I'm just not the right skin-type for this item, but I was very happy to try and learn I should save my money. I used the Olay Total Effects 7 in One Anti-Aging Moisturizer for the duration of the BzzCampaign to be able to provide an accurate account, and I'll stick with a more natural product to stay moisturized.

("I was pretty excited to try Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer, as there's a lot of hype around the product and some positive reviews. The packaging is quite attractive, and the pump top is great for dispensing control and keeping the product fresh. I was concerned with how little product the dispenser produced, but with Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer, less truly is more. The cream is very thick, rich and luxurious, and you really only need a small amount to get good coverage. It rubs on very smoothly, and does not feel oily or leave residue. It also kept my skin soft and moisturized the whole day. To the drawbacks - I wasn't keen on the scent it was more powerful than I expected initially, and it had a bit of that old lady smell to it. For an anti-aging cream, the smell did not exude youthfulness. Luckily the strong scent faded quickly so I didn't have to smell it all day. Also, I have sensitive skin, and experienced an uncomfortable tingling when I applied the product, as well as some mild skin irritation and reddening (that also, luckily, disappeared after about 20 minutes). After using it for a week, I have not seen any changes in the appearance of my lines or wrinkles, skin tone (worse after initial application...), etc. All in all, I wouldn't replace my current Olay Sensitive Skin daily moisturizer for this one, and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone with sensitive skin, but it still works decently as a general moisturizing cream.

I have blemish-prone skin and this did not cause any problems for my skin. This moisturizer didn't absorb into my skin right away. It took a few hours before I'd feel the hydration to my skin, but once my skin absorbed it my face felt nicely moisturized.

I usually would moisturize my face with coconut oil twice a day, after washing, so I incorporated the Olay moisturizer in once a day in the evenings before bed.

I also saw that my skin tone is even, my freckles (or age spots) are gone and that my pores on my nose are a bit smaller (this is huge for me as I have massive pores). Unfortunately, since it is winter, I'm not too sure if my age spots fading are actually due to the fact that I'm not in the sun as much, as it's dark by 4 and when it is light out it's overcast/raining or from Olay Total Effects. One more note is that the fragrance is horrendous. It smells just like the Olay Regenerist product, and I'm not a fan. My husband is not a fan either he can't stand smell!

When using this product I didn't consider its effects on fine lines and wrinkles, pores or age spots as these do not concern me.

I am more comfortable using this product during the day if I don't intend to go outside.

When I applied it to my face I was surprised how light it felt. It dried quickly and did not leave my face feeling heavy or greasy, it also wasn't shinny. Once it dried it did not seem to smell anymore either.

("After receiving the sample for Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer this review is based on 4 uses. I like the texture of the cream it's not too thick or too running and applies well. The scent could be a little lighter but is only noticeable when the moisturizer is applied to the nose area. I like that it is oil free and doesn't give a shine to my face and it blends well with my cc cream. The vitamins that are in this moisturizer (C,E) and VitaNiacin complex are bonuses and it's good to know that I am putting vitamins into my skin. However, many creams that have skin exfoliation make my skin rub off into the cream leaving my face with pieces of dead skin that I have to brush off. Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer does this as well but to a minimal degree. I like it more than the Olay regenerist Luminous tone perfecting cream. For this reason I will use this when I am not in a hurry. Also, I like that it doesn't burn my skin or give a redness or tingle. The pump bottle is good too I prefer it over a tube but the lid is very hard to open. (The full size bottle may not have this problem).

I love that there is a slight fragrance but it's not over powering which is a must in my books. As far as visibly smoothing fine lines and wrinkles- I can't say I have enough predominant lines and wrinkles to even notice a difference. I don't have uneven skin tone, so I can't vouch for that either. As far as enhancing brightness- I might notice a small difference- but mainly around the time of application, which is at bed time for me. I will say though I did notice a change in the appearance of my pours beside my nose! The only time I fee as though my skin is firmer is for about 20 minutes initially after applying the cream- and only around my eyes.

("Pros: Non-Greasy, minimizes the appearance of fine lines and pores, glides on nicely Cons: Maybe, possibly the scent. It's subtle, but (for me) the scent it does have seems 'chemically' In a Nutshell: Olay says This formula with its VitaNiacin Complex fights the 7 signs of aging with vitamin B3. This product claims to: Minimize the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles Moisturize to soothe and nourish dry skin Balance colour and tone while reducing the appearance of age spots My Experience This vitamin-enriched cream glides on easily and absorbs nicely into the skin without leaving a sticky residue or feeling too heavy. I really like the pump action no fingers in a jar, and a little goes a long way. My skin does appear to have a healthier glow and my skin tone seems balanced out although, I think that's due to the brightening effect, which is likely some sort of pigment in the cream, causing a trick of the light effect. So....not as spectacular as it seems. The unique vitamin formula contains vitamins B and E, which help nourish the skin, minimize pores, and diminish fine lines.

("Ugh! I am so on the fence about this moisturizer! One the one hand, I know the Olay brand has been around a long time and you don't stick around if you have bad products! The quality of the moisturizer is good with regards to texture and consistency, but the fragrance is putting me off and the fact that it stung my skin when I used it after I washed my face. I tried it again another day at night, a few hours after I washed and it was okay. The problem I have, is that I like to put my moisturizer on right after my shower as I have dry skin and I find it works better for me that way. I am torn if I should try the fragrance free version. (I WISH that had been an option we were given) Also, I can't tell if there is something in this moisturizer that gives a nice glow or it is giving me a glow because it's working! Either way, I think under light makeup it would be nice because it does give my pale skin a lovely glow. I also can't tell yet if it is smoothing my fine lines. I don't know about the whole minimize the look of pores thing. I don't any moisturizer could really do that - but I will see how this performs when I use it more.

("Common problem for women in their thirties is that signs of aging starting to show up in our face. Wrinkles and age spots are my main concern that prompted me to sit down with my tablet and search for products that will help me fight my struggle.

I have been using the moisturizer for 2 days now and counting. I like the mild scent and the non sticky feel. I have also felt a mild sting in my nose area after applying it but disappears right away in 2-3 minutes. I am hoping this is the sign that the cream is doing its magic.

The product itself has a pleasant scent, but it's a little strong when you first apply it. It's texture is smooth, and even though it's tinted, it blends in nicely with my skin tone. I normally use a tinted moisturizer with sunscreen, and I have found the Olay Total Effects product to be not as effective in moisturizing.

It is not too thick and not too thin. You only need to use a little for your whole face. However, I have not noticed any difference in fine line and age spots. I still see the wrinkles and age spots that I had before. But my face feels quite smooth but honestly, I never really had problems with uneven skin. I have yet to find a product that dramatically reduces wrinkle and age spots. Overall, I think it is a good face cream that will moisturize your skin but I'm not sure of the anti-aging qualities.

But I just dont see a big change in the ones I have. I have always liked the Olay brand and their products, maybe this one just isnt for me. As just a mosturizing lotion I think its great. Silky feeling and wasnt sticky also dried fast. Because im putting it on before bed I am happy it is fragrance free as im not big on scents while sleeping.

It had: - great scent - smooth texture - felt nice after application However, in my case I also found some negatives. One minor thing that I did not like was the product still felt more oily than I prefer for a face cream. The other negative is that I found my eyes watering and stinging within about a minute of using the product. I tried using it twice but both times I had the same problem...and no I did not apply it close to my eyes. I was very careful how I apply it. Because of this I did not continue using this product.

I used it in place of my regular moisturizer for a week and a half to test it out. First of all, I love the texture. It comes out like a mousse and it just melts into my face. I could just put this on all day. I do have dry skin to begin with, but after a few days I noticed it was even dryer than normal even though I applied it twice a day. I also noticed I was getting more blackheads on my nose but that went away after a few days. I didn't really noticed any improvement in the 7 signs of aging. My fine lines look about the same, my pores are bigger around the nose (see the attached picture), and my skin is dryer and rougher than with my standard moisturizer (it looks shiny in the picture but that's just the flash - it's VERY dry to the touch). I think Olay makes good products and my mom swears by them, but her skin is combination/oily.

I had roughly 4 pimples on each cheek it was absolutely disheartening but now I know the sensitivity of my skin.

I wanted to try the product though so I figured out a way to get it to land on my hand then I could apply it. I first noticed the smooth and silky texture which I absolutely loved. Applying it was a breeze and wasn't sticky or oily and had a very pleasant fragrance, not too strong. I was really impressed with the texture and how silky it felt. It dried fast but left my skin very silky and soft. Since this was a trial size I was unable to see any major results as I would have needed more product to use over a longer time frame.

What I like about it is that it is very light and absorbs quickly without feeling like you have a cream on at all.

I did find that it had a very light but pleasant scent that dissipated with absorption. Although I look for help with anti-aging , I also have acne prone skin. I maintained my regular nightly skincare routine, and I did not find that adding this moisturizer in the morning caused an acne flair up of any kind. On the Anti-aging side, I feel that it did somewhat brighten and even the tone of my skin, but I did not find that it did much for dark circles under my eyes and fine lines and wrinkles around my mouth and eyes.

Thus, I was happy to try Olay Total Effects, particularly when I read that one of its seven ant-aging benefits was to visibly reduce age spots. The bottle was cute and the scent light, not cloying (I dislike overly scented products). The creme itself seemed on the think side, and it didn't take much to smooth on my face. My skin felt moisturized and silky, though a little sticky because the creme is so thick. A pretty good start! However, my major problem with Olay Total Effects was that after two more days of using it, my skin got a big itchy, perhaps a mild allergic reaction, especially around my jaw line, so unfortunately I had to stop using it. I can't give a full review of how it might have improved my skin after three or four weeks, but I can say that for those who don't have a reaction like me, Olay Total Effects certainly is worth trying, because Olay is such a well-respected brand and the creme was quite luxurious!

("I was very surprised when I received the Olay Total Effects 7in1 trial sized bottle. I didn't think it would be possible to see results by the end of the bottle. I was pleasantly surprised. My immediate reaction to the moisturizer with the light scent and creamy texture. Very little was needed to cover my whole face and neck. It went on smooth and absorbed quickly. My skin instantly felt soft and smooth. Over time, I noticed that the vitamin complex in Olay Total Effects was actually beginning to fight some of the 7 signs of aging. For me, the first signs which began to improve was my uneven skin tone and the fine lines between my eyebrows began to soften. I didn't look as angry as I usually do. After many weeks of using this product my skin improves everyday. My skin is defiantly more hydrated and therefore looks much healthier. I like how my makeup can easily be worn on top of this product and stays put with very little retouching. I will continuing to use this moisturizer and watch as my skin improves while fighting the signs of aging. This review was collected as part of a promotion.", {'entities': [(41, 45, 'PRODUCT')]})
("I've never tried Olay, so this was a first for me. The packaging was like any other anti-aging moisturizer product. The scent was nice and the texture of the moisturizer was nice and smooth too. I've tested the product for about a week now and here are the results: (Just to let you know, I'm in my young thirties, normal-dry skin and no visible wrinkles or lines except for 1-2 frown lines near mouth) Visibly smoothes fine lines and wrinkles - No noticeable change! Evens skin tone appearance - Some changes Enhances brightness - Skin got brighter after second day! Minimizes the look of pores - Yes! Visibly reduces age spots - Don't have any Restores firmness - Not noticeable! Replenishes moisture - Yess!!! Smooth and hydrated skin after first application! So, I got 4/7 out of the moisturizer! Would I recommend it Not for my age group! It might work more effectively for 40s and up! SO for me I would stick to a regular moisturizer.

("After trying out Olay Total Effect 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer for a few weeks I can say that it's pretty good. I like that it moisturizes well, yet is not oily. I have very oily skin and it does not make me a greaseball at the end of the day. It also does not make me break out, which is awesome. It has no offense smell. I like the pump dispenser which is sanitary. I have not noticed any changes in fine lines nor is my skin tone more even. However, these are not huge problem areas for me. I also do not have any age spots, so I can't say if their claim to reduce the appearance of age spots is accurate or not. My main concerns are to keep my oily face from glistening at the end of the day and to not break out (have acne on my face). This Olay product addresses my concerns. The thing I do not like about this moisturizer is that it contains parabens. I am trying to use more natural products without parabens and other preservatives. If you do not mind parabens then you should try this product. It's good in other regards. This review was collected as part of a promotion.", {'entities': [(17, 21, 'PRODUCT')]})
("My skin is fairly dry and I found that Olay Total Effects did a good job at moisturizing my skin. Some moisturizers make my skin red and hot, but this one was ok. I was a bit concerned because it isn't fragrance free. I don't really understand perfuming your face, but this product wasn't too strong. I can't say I noticed much change in my fine lines or skin texture. Basically all i found was that this product does as good a job as my regular moisturizer. However, my regular moisturizer has SPF while the Olay Total Effects does not. Kind of ironic to have a moisturizer that fights the seven signs of aging without helping to *prevent* aging with SPF!! I also noticed that after about a week of using the product once a day, I started getting some pimples. I haven't had pimples for years, so I was a bit surprised to see them popping up. The only change I made was my moisturizer, so I suspect the pimples are related to that. So, while this product did a good job of moisturizing my dry skin, its has more drawbacks for me than positives.

I find myself looking for moisturizers and sun protection all at the same time since I find that the snow sometimes makes the sun burns worse for winter activities and when we do have beautiful weather I want to be out there soaking it up. Its a good product. My face is very sensitive but this doesn't affect that. My skin feels softer and is less dry then usual in this weather however I haven't an increase in youthfulness of my skin. The cream is slightly thicker than I am used to and it doesn't have a strong fragrance. It applies easily, but I found it took a while to sink into my skin.

("Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer is a great product if you start using it in your 30's, but when you're closer to 50 there's just not enough of what mature skin needs to produce visible effects, it's a very effective moisturizer, but for age spots and uneven skin tone it merely provides an optical illusion, any decent moisturizer will reduce the appearance of fine lines, at least temporarily. My skin does feel silky smooth and it is wonderful for making make-up apply better. The scent is a tiny bit strong when first applied, but that fades in a matter of minutes. All that being said, this is only 2 weeks in, and I will definitely give the product the full 4 weeks and post again. I am however very impressed with the size, to be able to purchase something this size at a reasonable price rather than having to pay for a full size of something that may not work for you is fantastic, if only other products would take the hint.

As far as making the statement that it visibly smooths fine lines and wrinkles, I can just say that I haven't gotten any more nor have they gotten worse. I did like that it is a thick cream.

I have never been much of a person to carry on a regime of skin car but I thought maybe after trying the product and seeing results it would change my mind. I was wrong. Though the creams texture is rich and thicker I really didn't see any difference from all the other creams I have tried. I must admit I did like how soft and smooth my skin felt but other then that to me it was just another cream. Mind you opposed to other creams I've used it is one of the most affordable. Remember as well my skin has already suffered from some of the aging signs including fine lines and wrinkles. Maybe if this cream was used before some of these things began on my skin my thoughts may be different. For me I am not sure I would go out to purchase this product.

("Having tried this moisturizer for a few weeks I have found that this is a good product. I like that this lotion isn't super heavy but it also isn't one of those extra light milks. I have combination skin with an oily congested t-zone. This soothes the dry parts of my face but doesn't irritate the oily parts. I didn't notice any changes in the brightness, tone or fine lines on my skin. Perhaps after a longer period of usage I would see some of the loftier claims but as of now this is just a good moisturizer. One thing I did notice was the smell. I really dislike scents but this one has a faint scent that reminds me of classic Oil of Olay products. Yay for nostalgia. Bottom line for me is that if you need a good drugstore moisturizer than this is a good one to think about.

I have combination skin, I find that my cheeks get dry as the seasons get colder. Even though the temperatures this fall winter have been very mild in my area, I have still noticed the dryness in the air effecting my skin elsewhere (lips, hands, legs, etc.). So, I am very pleased to notice that my facial skin has not felt dry since trying Olay Total Effects. However, I haven't seen a noticeable difference in some of the anti-aging effects that this product promises to deliver. That being said, I'm only 26 years old thankfully have not noticed many signs of aging anyway. I don't really have fine lines or wrinkles yet, nor do I have issues with age spots or firmness. But, I've always been told that it's never to early to start using anti-aging products, the keys to looking youthful are moisturizer sunscreen.

("I have used Olay Total Effects 7 in one Anti-Aging Moisturizer daily for two weeks. One pump and the lotion bottle dispenses an appropriate amount for spreading over my face. I am enjoying the light fragrance, and soft and non-greasy feel of the lotion. The moisturizer spreads fairly well and soaks into my skin quickly. My skin does feel a bit softer and more supple after use. That being said, Olay makes rather bold claims about what this anti-aging moisturizer will do. It boasts that the product visibly smoothes fine lines and wrinkles, evens skin tone appearance, enhances brightness, minimizes the look of pores, visibly reduces age spots, restores firmness, and replenishes moisture. I'm not sure my skin tone looks any more even or bright, or that my age spots are really any lighter. As a light moisturizer, this Olay product is alright, but I haven't noticed any dramatic changes.

("O.kit's been over 4 weeks since i've put Olay Total Effects to the test. I love the packaging. I love that it only dispenses a little amount with every pump. Because you cannot put the product back in if you pump too much(which is good actually. You don't want product exposed and open to contamination or eventually expiration of quality). I appreciated the perfect amount that it pumped and on a very dry day i used a little more. It first feels very rich on my skin and i'm not sure if i'm going to like how heavy it feltthen it really just melted into my face. A little goes a long way. The scent is pleasant- almost too strong for my likingbut not off-putting. I have been using it religiously and have not noticed a change in the appearance of my skin. My skin tone remains the same. My age spots are still as front and centre as usual. And my wrinkles aren't any smoother. What i will tell you though.is my skin is baby soft!!! My husband even mentioned it.

I didn't notice any change in the brightness, skin tone, fine lines or wrinkles, or any of the other effect -other than moisturize. I've used the product daily for over 3 weeks now and although I enjoy it as a moisturizer, I won't continue using the product. I've been having outbreaks of pimples (big) on my chin area since using. This is unlike my skin, as I don't have an issue with breakouts and acne. I've used many Olay products in the past, and have been satisfied, but I can't say the same with this product - unfortunately, as I do wish it worked with my skin!

("I come from a long line of Olay users. I still remember that distinctive smell that it gave my grandmother. So I was pretty excited to give An Olay product a try. In the past the price along was enough to divert me to my current Aveeno moisturizer. And I think I'll stick with the Aveeno. The first time I applied Olay Total Effects 7-in-1 moisturizer it burned a little, but I chalked that up to how dry my skin must be. That old familiar Olay scent was there- and it's not as appealing as I recall. Actually, it smells a bit like an old lady. What was nice about it was that it was non-greasy and kept my skin moisturized for most of the day. I've only been using it for 5 days, so can't comment on the age defying effects, but since I'd need to buy more to have enough to use it for the 4 weeks that is recommended to see results, I don't think I'll get there.

("I was excited to try the Olay Total Effects, as I normally use an inexpensive cream moisturizer. As a 50-something, I was hoping it would produce some great results. Unfortunately, even after using it for a few weeks, the results have been underwhelming. While it did appear to fade an age spot, which was wonderful, it really didn't do anything for the fine lines or wrinkles - certainly not enough for anyone to comment on - maybe my lines and wrinkles are too well developed! Also, I had to stop using it on my nose, as it broke out - something that hasn't happened since my teenage years. It does have a nice feel - smooth and silky - goes on easily, doesn't have a strong smell, and comes in a cute little container that dispenses easily - all positives. Overall, it works fine as a moisturizer (except on my nose), seems to fade age spots a bit, but does nothing for my lines and wrinkles.

For me, the fragrance was not an irritant and I quite enjoyed it. My conclusion is that while this product performed well in making my skin appear smoother, it would also be a bit pricey to maintain use. The trial size product may help to keep cost down but, there are other, more comparable, products on the market that can give you similar or better results for less money. I am satisfied with my experience in using Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer but, I will most likely continue using my previous products.

To be honest, the difference seems very minimal to me. All of the things I liked about the product from the start still hold true today. In general it did a good job of keeping my face moisturized, but on several occasions when my skin was more dehydrated it didn't do quite enough to keep the skin from looking dry.

Her skin is good except for darkness around the eyes and a bit of slackness. She has been using it for days now and hasn't reported any improvement to me yet but I expect that in time she will notice a brightening of overall tone, firming and lightening and reduction of fine lines around the eyes and corner of the mouth.

She works in a kitchen and doesn't take great care with herself though I encourage her to. I've also encouraged her to take vitamins and and bought her body care products (olay body wash and body lotion) are well as we a both getting on (40+).

It is a great size for travel, or even for those who don't go through a lot of product and don't want a full size bottle on their sink. After using the moisturizer for a few weeks, I am breaking down the 7 effects that are claimed in relation to how I feel they applied to my use. 1. Visibly smoothes fine lines and wrinkles: I don't have a lot of lines just yet, but this product made applying my makeup smoother with less creasing. 2. Evens skin tone appearance: I didn't find a change in my skin tone - I tend to have redness and discoloration in some areas and this remained the same. 3. Enhances brightness: I did not find a difference in the brightness of my complexion. 4. Minimizes the look of pores: The Olay moisturizer was a nice base before my foundation, and did smooth out my few visible pores around my nose. 5. Visibly reduces age spots: I cannot comment to this claim, since age spots are not a factor (yet!) 6. Restores firmness: My skin did feel nice and smooth/supple after applying. 7. Replenishes moisture: I found that this product would likely be better in the summer for me. It is a light moisturizer, and couldn't quite combat the tightness of my drier winter skin. I have combination skin, but it wasn't quite hydrating enough this fall/winter. I would probably recommend this product for skin that is a bit oilier, or in milder weather. Overall, I found Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer to be a nice lightweight moisturizer which absorbed into my skin well, and had a mild, pleasant scent. It does claim to be fragrance free, however it does have a faint scent to it. Although I don't see the brightening effects mentioned, or evening of my skin tone, this would be a good summer moisturizer, and a handy size. I only wish it had been a little more hydrating for me.

("I am a person who is used to being told I look much younger than my age, and quite frankly, I would like to keep it that way, so I was pretty excited to try Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer as I have begun to start showing the signs of aging around my eyes and thought this was a great opportunity to give another product a shot at diminishing those nasty little wrinkles. I was also quite excited to see if my pores would actually minimize in size as I have noticed that with aging, my pores have gotten larger. On a daily basis, I usually use an oil free moisturizer containing SPF 15, then at night, after washing and applying toner, I apply an anti aging serum. My skin is sensitive and can be adult acne prone, so I decided I would only use the Olay Total Effects and continue with my regular washing and toner habit. At first, I felt positively about the new moisturizer it felt great on my skin, it wasn't too thick when applying and my makeup went on smoothly atop of it. I even told some fellow mom's about how it was keeping my face feeling fresh, even in the snowy weather we had been having. I continued with my new routine for a few days, then I noticed that my skin was becoming a bit aggravated and I started breaking out (uh oh). I became a little concerned, but continued using Olay Total Effects, but still, I broke out and I had to discontinue its use (because honestly, I'll take clear skin over some small wrinkles). I have looked at the ingredients, and although it is oil free (a huge plus), it does contain glycerin, which can cause my skin to become irritated. Although I didn't get to use the product for the suggested length of time to see its full effect on my wrinkles or my pores, I can say that a person would feel moisturized throughout the day, even in harsh winter weather and can feel confident about her makeup staying on atop of it.

("In order to properly review this product in the hopes of helping others make an informed buying decision, I need to use the product over an extended period of time. I have only been using the product for 3 days and I would like to at least give it a week to see what it is capable of. This review will be one of two with this one commenting on the product itself and my opinions on that. I have used Olay products in the past and I have not been a fan due to the fact that they have either broken me out or made me feel really oily and greasy. First off, I LOVE that the Olay Total Effects is oil free. As someone with highly sensitive skin, this is a winner for me already. I break out super easily and although it is still to early to tell, I don't anticipate this being harmful on my skin. It contains a few different Vitamins and claims not to be harsh on skin so I am excited to see what it is able to do for me. There is a mild scent in the lotion but it is nothing overpowering or distasteful - I usually prefer a scented lotion but it feels awkward when it is scented and on my face... I do wish that it was fragrance free but it is mild enough that it will not be a deal breaker for me. As I have noticed with previous Olay Products I have tried for my face, this one is not greasy. Maybe that has to do with the fact that it is oil free I am not sure exactly, but I find that it is fast absorbing as it claims and it does not leave my face makeup streaky or greasy. My only complaint with the lotion is that it feels a bit heavy on my face. I prefer to not be able to feel what I have on my face and this scares me as I feel like it is not giving my pores room to breathe AKA I do not want to break out! Lastly, I love the 7 in 1 idea but I question whether it is truly possible. The sellers for me in this lotion are the effects of evens skin tone appearance, brightness, and moisture. This excites me because I feel like out of the 7 things it claims to do, my three struggles are the easiest three to fix. So far, I would say that I am 50/50 on the product. I like how the product is oil-free and not greasy, but I find it heavy on my face. I love how it claims to be gentle on the skin but I am hesitant on that claim based on my previous experiences with the Olay brand. So far I am satisfied with my three day results although I don't feel it is accurate to lay claim until I have given the product about a week to work. My skin does feel great and the lotion is moisturizing but so far I can't say that it is better than the lotion I currently use. I will update in about 5 days with a review on the 7 Olay Effects!

("I gave this a rating of three even though I won't be purchasing this again because I do think it is a product that lives up to many of the claims. However, I found it to actually be very drying on my skin, and actually by about day three found I was having to put another moisturizer on after it just to get rid of that tight skin feeling on my face. I made sure to just use a regular body moisturizer though so that I could see how it did on other claims. Here are my observations: Visibly smoothes fine lines and wrinkles - yes, Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging did help with fine lines and wrinkles, but I don't think it did significantly better than my regular brand (Loreal) at this. Evens skin tone appearance - I didn't notice a difference, but to be fair my skin tone is pretty even in general. Enhances brightness - I thought that Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging did well in this category. My skin definitely looked brighter when I used it. Minimizes the look of pores - also thought that Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging did well at this. I usually use Biore strips on my nose and didn't even need to while I was applying this (and I was checking closely! lol). Visibly reduces age spots - Another category that Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging did well in. I don't have a lot of age spots, but hey I'm 41 there are a few! It did do a good job at visibly reducing those I do have. Restores firmness - I didn't find that Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging made much of a difference in this category versus my normal cream (Loreal). Replenishes moisture - definite fail in this category. Right from night one when I applied the Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging cream my skin felt tight and dry. I resisted putting on any other moisturizers the first couple of nights, but it was pretty extreme (to the point I was so happy to put my morning cream on).

("Initially, I was thrilled to be a part of this campaign. Oil of Olay has a strong reputation for being a dependable product and I even use the soap to wash my face. As I have sensitive skin there are only a few types of cleansers that I can use. So, when it came to trying the oil of Olay seven in one antiaging moisturizer I was excited. When I got the trial size I have to admit, I didn't read all the fine print and I was a little disappointed that it was only the trial size, but having the opportunity to try moisturizer that was less expensive then the current antiaging moisturizer I am using I wanted to give it a try. I had to use more than was necessary, due to the fact that I live in a cold climate. It had minimal smell, which is important to me, because I am sensitive to fragrances. I was also excited, that the moisturizer did not irritate my skin. I live in Alberta where the weather can be extreme from one end to the other, I found that I needed to use a fair amount of the moisturizer to compensate for the dry cold winter weather that I was experiencing with my face. It would've been nice to have a full bottle to see The claims that the moisturizer was advertising. I found that trying to sample size bottle it was not enough for me to make the claims that the bottle was stating. Overall the oil of Olay seven in one antiaging moisturizer was OK. If I had to try it again, I would buy a full-size bottle. I would however, try it in the summer because of the extreme weather I live in. I need a much heavier moisturizer to combat the dryness that I experience in the winter months here. The trial size bottle maybe good for little getaways where you need a quick moisturizer but as a daily dependable moisturizer I was neutral.

It also allows for an easy and clean application. The product is more of a cream consistency and is lightly fragranced. The product claims to fight seven signs of aging: 1. Visibly smoothes fine lines and wrinkles 2. Evens skin tone appearance 3. Enhances brightness 4. Minimizes the look of pores 5. Visibly reduces age spots 6. Restores firmness 7. Replenishes moisture After trying this product for 2 weeks I can honestly say I did not see all of the above results. I did find that the moisturizer evened out my skin tone. My skin tone was less red looking and more uniform. I also found the moisturizer did replenish moisture and left my skin nicely hydrated for the whole day. As for the other benefits, I did not see any results. I have very fine lines around my eyes but saw no change. My skin still seemed to have a dull appearance. I have large pores in the cheek area close to my nose but didn't find they were minimized with the use of this product. I didn't notice any change in the firmness of my skin. I actually don't have age spots yet so I can't really comment on that aspect. Perhaps with continued use of this product I would see more of the claimed benefits in my skin. I do suffer from oily, acne prone skin. I'm happy to report that my skin did not get any oilier than usual. However, I did develop a few pimples while using this product. Maybe it was too rich for my skin or maybe I was going to get those pimples regardless of what I used. My final opinion on this product is that it is an excellent moisturizer but not a good anti-aging moisturizer. I would recommend it as a good every day moisturizer but would skip it for its anti-aging benefits. This review was collected as part of a promotion.", {'entities': [(15, 19, 'PRODUCT')]})

I did have a nice shine in my hair and it did smell good, but otherwise it is a no go for me. But everyone has to try it so they came make their own opinion and decide for themselves.

("I have been using the Age Defy line for about a month now and while I love the smell of the product (and the lather that the shampoo provided) I really cannot give this conditioner a great review. I felt that I really had to use a lot of it on my hair which is highlighted, a bit dry, thin and fine. I ended up finally purchasing a good finishing oil to get a result which I didn't have to do with my previous conditioner.

('My husband and I use Pantene products regularly. This was our first time however, trying Pantene Expert Pro-V AgeDefy Conditioner. Personally, I was not a fan of this product right from the start. I did not like the scent at all. It has a peculiar medicinal-like smell to it which put me off immediately. Also, I found that these products (both the Pantene Expert Pro-V AgeDefy Shampoo Conditioner) were too rich for my fine hair oily scalp. My hair was left lifeless, with no volume and unmanageable. I make an effort not to wash my colour-treated hair everyday to maintain the colour longer. This certainly is not possible with Pantene Expert Pro-V AgeDefy Conditioner. By the second day after using the shampoo and conditioner, my hair was greasy, flat and smelled bad. Since this product was not right for me, I decided to pass it on to my husband who reports back to me that he likes Pantene Expert Pro-V AgeDefy Conditioner and will likely continue buying it. Although this product is not right for me, it did end up being a success for my husband. This review was collected as part of a promotion.', {'entities': [(21, 28, 'PRODUCT')]})
("BzzAgent offered to send me Pantene Pro-V shampoo and conditioner. I chose the Age Defy as the claim stated on the bottle is that it instantly restores youthful vitality. Sounded great, right When I received the bottle I noted that it stated 7 signs of aging hair: (1) breakage (2) split ends (3) frizz (4) unruly greys (5) lackluster colour (6) thin look (7) dryness My hair definitely suffers from breakage and split ends, and there are indeed a few unruly greys...perhaps a little more every day. The other issues weren't really a concern for me, but since it was sent to me for free I figured I'd give it a go. I was intrigued by the bottle. It didn't match it's shampoo sister. Instead of being tall and thin, it was almost conical, with the opening at the bottom. Very smart design as it allows the viscous product to settle down at the spout, and thus render it easier to squeeze out of the bottle. I also liked that the plastic was malleable, making it easy to dispense product. I was surprised that there was only 237mL of product in the condition, compared to the 285mL of shampoo since most folks tend to use more conditioner than shampoo. Like the shampoo, the conditioner has that typical Pantene scent, which I find pleasant and not overwhelming. It has a thick and creamy consistency which spreads easily over the hair strands, and combs through nicely withinthe shower. I always use both shampoo and conditioner so it is difficult to comment on how the conditioner works on its own. I can say that my hair felt silky smooth, which I suspect is due to the presence of silicone in the conditioner. My hair smelled great, but there wasn't any noticeable change. I still had breakage and I still had split ends, and my greys were just as unruly as they had been. All in all, I'm rating this conditioner 3 out of 5 starts. In my mind, it is pretty average. My hair felt smooth, but it became oddly subject to static electricity which I had not experienced prior. Like its shampoo sister, it left my hair smelling pleasant, but I hope most conditioners would do so. I would not go out of my way to pick up another bottle, but I would certainly use it again if it were provided to me.

("As a conditioner, the Pantene Expert Pro-V AgeDefy did not perform any better or worse than any other Pantene conditioner and the scent was nice. If I accidentally used too much, before the end of the day my hair would look greasy and stringy. Applied just to the ends and it left too many tangles to comb out. A full-sized bottle lasted almost an entire month and while I don't have super thick hair, I do have long hair and I wash and condition it daily. Overall, I would not spend the extra money to buy the Expert Pro-V line. This review was collected as part of a promotion.", {'entities': [(22, 29, 'PRODUCT')]})

It seems to affect my asthma and though I still use the shampoo the conditioner, for me, is out. I'll stick to my favorite Pantene conditioners and chalk this up as a learning experience.

("While I was disappointed with the Age defy shampoo from Pantene, the conditioner definitely ranks higher. The bottle design is great, and I am able to get every last bit of of it. The new design is definitely a plus. The scent is lovely too. Not over powering, but stays with me throughout the day. I have thin fine hair that falls below my shoulders, and a small dollop covers from root to tip. The coverage is great. Rinsing it out is easy, without the buildup or taking extra time to rinse. My hair feels softer, even when still damp. My brush goes through smoothly without much tugging or struggling required. I do notice I still have some flyaways after drying. It's still soft and supple though, which is nice. I will say, it didn't really meet all of the claims for Age Defy. However, I am definitely going to try the different Pantene products with the hope that age defy just want the right choice for my hair type.

("I think this is a very good conditioner. It comes out of the tube like a rich, creamy moisturizer and smells fantastic. I have been using Pantene products for years, but I have used this conditioner for about two weeks. For starters it is way thicker and more luxurious than other conditioners. Some conditioners are watery and runny. it lathers up really well and then washes out completely without leaving any residue that can weigh hair down. My biggest issues are aging hair, including unruly greys, lackluster dyed hair and dry hair. My hair is also naturally wavy and can get really frizzy, especially in the dry, cold Canadian winters. This conditioner addresses all these issues. My hair is soft and manageable and feels moisturized and well nourished. My scalp is not dry or itchy. My hair has a lot of bounce and movement in it.

("Pantene Expert Pro-V Age Defy Shampoo and Conditioner Thanks to BzzAgent and Pantene, Im trying this product for free!! First impressions mean everything! When I opened up my kit I immediately noticed the new sleeker bottle design. The slender black bottle has a no-fuss appeal and a higher end look and feel to it. Next came the scentAMAZING! It has an expensive salon smell, definitely not what I'd expect from a product you can buy at the drugstore. I have very thick long curly hair and finding a shampoo and conditioner that works for me is tough, to say the least. Lately, my hair has been showing the tell-tale signs of aging, dry, brittle, breakage, split ends, pesky gray hairs that pop up and scream 'YOOHOO, LOOK AT ME!' and, of course, dreaded FRIZZ. The biggest issues for me are all of the above so I was excited about trying out a product that claimed to be concocted to tackle all of my hair woes. So lets do it!! I've used this product for a little more than two weeks now and so far I'm thrilled. The shampoo has a thick and lasting lather. I could almost feel my hair getting thicker as I worked the lather through my hair. I was anxious to see how the conditioner would stack up. The thick creamy consistency is exactly what you want out of a conditioner. I worked the thick cream through my tangled mass of curls and then I waited a few minutes before rinsing. Wow! Huge impact! Manageable and easy to untangle, my hair looks and feels so soft and silky and the breakage issue is well on its way to being non-existent. Then theres the gray hair issue, they are now blended into my hair and not sticking up. I actually had to look for graysso much less noticeable!

After he\'s gotten good and used to the adulation his racing career brings, it has to stop. A \'medical\' condition threatens to kill him if he pursues that 110% lifestyle. So, he sets his sights elsewhere - not lower (as he was to find), but elsewhere, and among others, each with a past of their own.Then there\'s a "little engine that could" subtext, with plenty of setbacks. There\'s also the inspiring thought that a hero doesn\'t need to be a hero to anyone, or even known to be heroic. ("How do I get my picture on that wall?") There\'s more in that thought that I realized at first, the notion of being your own hero, and a real one, not just an ego-fantasy. Also, self-worth through achievement instead of an entitled feel-goodism, and seeing many contributors making very different contributions, and the snarky sense of comeuppance when that self-serving bureaucrat gets his mud-flaps pinned back, it all adds up to a healthy view of what a truly good life can be, in terms kids can grasp.But John Lassiter produced this and that\'s as good as a promise signed, sworn, and notarized saying you\'ll get technical excellence welded to warm characterization.

('What\'s the point? That\'s the question director Jon Favreau and the brass at Disney had to answer if they were going to justify the money and man hours required to bring the visually stunning "live action" version of Rudyard Kipling\'s The Jungle Book to the big screen some fifty years after the Disney animated version taught generations upon generations of children the bare necessities of life. What would be the point of retelling this story to the current generation in an updated form? What more could they bring to it that children might not elicit from that 1967 original? In short, would there be more of a point to it than simply showing off the technical wizardry of Weta Digital and their visual effects work? The funny thing is, we more than likely remember the 1967 version through nostalgia-filled eyes that cloud our judgment of the actual film. In going back and watching that film-the one I very much enjoyed as a child despite being born in the late eighties-it quickly became apparent there wasn\'t much substance to the story and that the film was more a collection of little scenes filled with different, but interesting animal personalities that featured catchy songs written by the Sherman brothers and very little more until Shere Khan showed up at the end to create some type of tension. And so, going into this latest version of Kipling\'s story that would pull from both that source material while being heavily inspired by the \'67 film the biggest improvement they could make would be in the story department by crafting a narrative that held a driving force with serious forward momentum and a throughline plot that, at the very least, would add a little more significance and reason to seeing the film in the first place. With screenwriter Justin Marks (whose only prior feature credits include a Street Fighter film and a TV movie) though, we are brought the one thing I couldn\'t even have imagined to add and that was a cohesion to the thinly connected events of the original animated movie. Giving purpose and connection that take Mowgli (Neel Sethi) from point A to point B lends the film a real ambition making the stunning visuals only more of an achievement.', {'entities': [(76, 82, 'PRODUCT')]})

I know that bags cost money but it does not compare to the frustration I feel when I am emptying a bagless. There weren't that many bagged vaccums to choose from in the stores but I am positive that I made the right choice. The Hoover did cost more than I had planned to spend but, I got the quality I hoped for. My carpets looked fantastic after just one cleaning!

Sometimes this happens within a couple days of installing a new bag so I know it cannot possibly need changing. I figured out what was happening and it is cat hair clogging the upper part of the bag. If I have a lot of cat hair to clean up this can happen because the hair does not fall to the bottom of the bag like normal weight debris will...instead, it gets sucked into the bag and stays right there at the top and after a few days of that happening, the change bag warning light comes on because the cat hair stuck at the top of the bag makes the machine think the bag is full.

("I wanted a bagged vacuum that was lightweight without compromising on features or breaking the bank. I did a lot of research and found this Hoover upright with separate canister. I liked the idea of a separate canister that I could pull out for little jobs or for vacuuming the car. I already own a (heavy) Hoover upright with all tools on board. My style of vacuuming is to grab the hose extender and tools to do those jobs as I go along - alternating between floor vacuuming and dusting. So, the new vacuum means that I have to change my habit - a minor concession that I am happy to make. I like this vacuum. It really is lightweight with controls right where you expect them. I like having the headlight (something you do not get with inexpensive and/or lightweight vacuums). Both the upright and the canister have lots of suction. I noticed right away that debris within a couple of inches of the nozzle was sucked right in. That told me that anything under the head was getting totally sucked in. The canister gives me so much freedom that I forget that it is wired and eventually I get out of range of the cord length and get pulled back to reality (it has a long electrical cord). Overall, for my money, this was a very good purchase. I don't like to vacuum but this vacuum makes the job easy. So that I don't leave anything out, here is a list of things I like about this vacuum: Lightweight Big debris bag Serious suction Long cord on both units Headlight Only as noisy as necessary Separate Canister for dusting or small jobs Intuitive control placements (on/off switch, tilt pedal) Well-placed handles Upright unit will lie down flat for vacuuming stairs and under furniture Easy to maneuver Narrow nozzle allows cleaning in tight spaces Full bag indicator (I have not seen this)", {'entities': [(140, 146, 'PRODUCT')]})

The hand-held vacuum is also light and easy to carry. Contrary to some reviewers, I did not find it particularly loud and the vacuum strength is adequate for cleaning corners and upholstery. One gripe is that there is no height adjustment on the upright, which makes it hard to push on plush rugs (very easy on hard floors and berber carpets). To counter this, I run the upright on low to reduce the vacuum strength which in turn makes pushing the vacuum easier. Gripe two is that the beater brush does not stop spinning when the upright is in the locked, upright position. I don't use the upright on hardwood floors, so this is not a big issue for me.

This vacuum, by far, outperforms the Oreck on cleaning and suction. Also the Oreck has left black marks on my customers carpets when the supposedly superior wheels get a little milage under them, and I have had more problems with the belts on the Oreck then the Hoover. The canister that comes with it is great as well. Nice long cord. Use it to on hardwood and tile before mopping to clean up dog hair, food, and debris and, of course, the stairs. Very easy to change the bag with a nice feature that keeps the dust from flying everywhere when you remove the bag (Oreck does not have this). Also a light takes the guess work out of when to change the bag. There is a convienent handle on the back of the vacuum that makes it extremely easy to carry up and down the stairs, and the canister has an adjustable and comfortable carrying strap. While cleaning floors with the canister the best way to wear this is with the strap all the way extended and across your body instead of hanging off your shoulder, that way you are free to move quickly and you won't have it slipping off your shoulder and dropping to the floor.

The Hoover WindTunnel U6439 bagged upright that Ive had for the last several years would suck up a Buick. Unfortunately, it also rivaled a Buick in the weight category. Although its supposedly a self-propelled model, I felt like I had to go into training in order to vacuum my house. It became something I would put off because I wasnt sure I had the strength to wrestle this bulky beast all over my house. The WindTunnel controls which allow you to change the brush height from carpet to floor were manual, hard-to-move levers on the brush housing which required you to shut the machine off in order to properly manipulate them. The HEPA filter on my old WindTunnel seemed to work only for the first few months. After that, all manner of airborne particles would fly around as I vacuumed, even after I cleaned/replaced the filters. Lastly, noise of my previous WindTunnel was something akin to a jet taking off.When I saw a TV commercial for the Hoover Platinum series machines, I was definitely intrigued. I loved the idea of getting two separate vacuums together for one price (brilliant marketing idea there, Hoover).

('I bought this vacuum pair based on the reviews. Had I simply been browsing in the store, I likely would have chosen something else because for the price, it doesn\'t look like you\'re getting much. I am so glad I went against my instincts and listened to what others have said about this unit. It\'s awesome! It leaves the carpet looking like it\'s just been steam cleaned, not merely vacuumed. (No, it won\'t remove stains. It just really picks up the nap and makes the capret look new.)This is a case of simpler being better. I work for another retailer that sells Dyson, Electrolux, Hoover, Eureka, and Oreck. I have seen that the units that get returned most often are the ones with too many bells and whistles and gimmicks. This set just does what it is supposed to do: vacuum carpets really well.The canister is super lightweight too, but has awesome suction. My only knock on it is I wish it had a little longer hose to make it more suitable for cleaning the car. But for inside the house, it\'s great. The extending tube locks at any length you choose and works great for hard floors and ceiling fans and stuff like that. The tools are nothing to get excited about, but do the job. I stopped at a local vacuum store and picked up a dusting brush with longer, softer bristles than the one supplied so that I could vacuum electronics without scratching up the plastics. ($7)Points that I would counter from other reviews:1. "The hose falls out of the canister easily."No, it does not. Twist the hose to lock it in place, and then it\'s acutally kind of hard to remove.2. "The canister is super loud."No, it\'s not. Of course this is subjective, but to me, it\'s much quieter than vacuums I\'ve had in the past.3. "The bags are very expensive and hard to find."The bags can be tricky to find in stores, but are readily available online. They\'re about $5 each, but to me that\'s not bad at all when you consider they are really big bags, you\'re getting HEPA filtration and never have to replace a seperate HEPA filter unit (which really can be pricey), and they have an automatic "trap door" that slides closed when you remove the bag so dust doesn\'t go flying everywhere.

An other feature worth mentioning that the upright is self-propelled and requires minimum effort to push and pull. Now our 2,200 sq.ft. floor space takes one third of the time to clean than with my previous ORECK, Dyson and other models. It is excellent on pet hair as well.

The hoover sucks equally along the brushes. Problem number two: the dyson frequently gets cloggs in that same hose. If it has cloggs, how can it suck? Apparently you have to take a wire hanger and fish out the hair and dust that caused the clogg...gross!Back to the hoover. Amazing! You can feel the resistance as you pull the vacuum back. I thought my floor was clean before, but the bag told me otherwise! I think it's strong enough to suck up its own cord (which is very long). It is much quieter than my old vacuum and the bag is made out of some cotton micro material that keeps all dust inside. The canister it comes with is great for small pick-ups or cars.

The portable unit that comes with it is handy and powerful as well. As long as we can get bags and parts to keep this vacuum running, it will always be cleaning our home. The only complaint I have is that the store we bought it at no longer carries it or the bags, so we have to order them from Hoover. GREAT JOB HOOVER!', {'entities': [(632, 638, 'PRODUCT')]})

After using a disgusting, clunky, poorly designed bagless Bissell, this is the most amazing vacuum I have ever used! My living room rug is an entire shade lighter! I don't feel like I need a shower after vacuuming now. I works beautifully on the stairs, no hoses needed. It picked up every crumb. I only had to change outlets once and I have a 2200 sqft quad level home! I have two small children, 1 dog 2 cats and it picked up everything! Assembled in minutes with one screw.

It is lighter than my other two vacuums which really makes a difference when carrying it to the second floor. It does an outstanding job on pet hair, stairs, and my multi-surfaced floors automatically. I love it! I am so confident that I disposed of my other two models.

("First, a disclaimer of sorts . I'm a long-term, died-in-the-wool Hoover evangelist. No, I don't work for Hoover, but I've always used them religiously for over 30 years. I've tried switching off to other top-of-the-line brands, but I always return to Hoover for their unsurpassed cleaning power and reliability. That does not, however, mean they were perfect. The Hoover WindTunnel U6439 bagged upright that I've had for the last several years would suck up a Buick. Unfortunately, it also rivaled a Buick in the weight category. Although it's supposedly a self-propelled model, I felt like I had to go into training in order to vacuum my house. It became something I would put off because I wasn't sure I had the strength to wrestle this bulky beast all over my house. The WindTunnel controls which allow you to change the brush height from carpet to floor were manual, hard-to-move levers on the brush housing which required you to shut the machine off in order to properly manipulate them. The HEPA filter on my old WindTunnel seemed to work only for the first few months. After that, all manner of airborne particles would fly around as I vacuumed, even after I cleaned/replaced the filters. Lastly, noise of my previous WindTunnel was something akin to a jet taking off.When I saw a TV commercial for the Hoover Platinum series machines, I was definitely intrigued. I loved the idea of getting two separate vacuums together for one price (brilliant marketing idea there, Hoover). But I was skeptical could the power of a Hoover truly be housed in something that weighs only 11 pounds I'd tried other lightweight vacuums in the past and their suction was dubious at best. I made a beeline for the Internet to start researching. Over a couple of days of intensive reading (yes, I'm very thorough), I decided to continue my trust in Hoover and took the plunge. Both machines come packaged together in a single tall box which was waiting for me on my front porch when I got home from work. The first thing I noticed was that I could actually lift the entire box into the house without grunting like a Sumo wrestler that was promising. After removing everything, I was stunned at the weight or lack thereof for both machines.The physical appearance is very appealing the upright is sleek and slim with a 35' long cord, and the canister has tools-on-board, along with an ingenious shoulder strap so you can wear it while you vacuum. You will be stunned by how little these machines weigh a child could easily lift them both. But could they cleanWhen I fired up the Platinum upright, the word that kept coming out of my mouth was WOW. First off, no more jets taking off in my living room just a pleasing HUM. Second, this impossibly lightweight wonder gives a whole new meaning to the term self-propelled. It seemingly FLOATED over my carpeting all on its own, while still having the suck-up-a-Buick power I expected from a Hoover. It cleaned better in one pass than its older U6439 WindTunnel behemoth cousin did in several passes. I was picking up stuff I didn't even know was there. How about making a pass underneath your bed, or behind your dresser that you haven't moved since you moved in 15 years ago It was astonishing how well this machine worked in just one pass.I have a rather large, bulky throw rug in my kitchen that I had been preparing to replace because it had become so un-vacuum-able in recent weeks. The Platinum upright made it look brand new. And hallelujah for a TRUE edge cleaner! Everyone claims to have edge cleaning ability on their uprights, but this one truly delivers on the promise. Think about those sneaky areas in your house where all sorts of stuff lingers like that dead zone along the baseboards tucked up under the bottom of your kitchen cabinets where they meet the kitchen floor. This Platinum upright sucked up all that debris immediately right to the edge. The maneuverability of the Platinum upright is astonishing. It truly is as light as Hoover claims and it moves as easily as a Dyson. The upright portion of the machine lowers completely parallel to the floor so it really can move under coffee tables with ease. It also moves from carpeting to floors effortlessly with an intelligent, lighted, fingertip control right up there on the handle. The HEPA filtration is light-years ahead of my previous WindTunnel think HEPA with a Hemi under the hood. Yes, I know that bags are expensive, but you can find discounts if you search online and buy in bulk. Plus, I don't mind paying for a product that truly works these bags, and this new Platinum HEPA filtration system, truly work. No dust or other airborne nasties were visible anywhere.The Platinum canister has a carrying strap, which makes so much sense. The maintenance crew who cleans my office building uses strap-on canister vacuums and I always thought that was such an intelligent design now, I've got my own. And all the tools are right there attached to the unit, ready and waiting for you. I toted that canister all over the house, cleaning window sills, ceiling corners, air conditioning vents, everything! Then I walked into the garage and started cleaning the inside of my SUV. It's quiet, powerful and incredibly portable the best canister I've ever used.In my first test run of this Hoover Platinum vacuum system, I found myself LOOKING for stuff to clean I couldn't get enough of it. The Hoover UH30010COM Platinum is, quite simply, the best vacuum PERIOD I've ever owned. I absolutely LOVE this machine and to get 2 vacuums an upright and a canister for the same price just makes terrific economic sense. It has extraordinary power in a relatively quiet, sleek, lightweight package that doesn't leave me feeling deaf, sore and exhausted. Bravo, Hoover!Run, don't walk, to get the Hoover UH30010COM Platinum vacuuming system you will not be disappointed.", {'entities': [(65, 71, 'PRODUCT')]})
("This is my first Hoover. I love that its lightweight so easy to push around my carpet and furniture. It was easy to set up and works like a dream. I love my new Hoover. The wind tunnel technology is amazing. I love the Hepa bags and now know that my house will be free of dust and allergens. Great suction and brush fluffed up my matted carpet. My 5 year old Kenmore recently died and I replaced it with this Hoover. I'm not disappoined. I'm very happy that I did. My Kenmore weighed a ton and was bulky. Hand held canister is great on corners and tile floors. Also great to clean around my air conditioning vents and dryer lint catcher area. I am very satisfied with this vacuume.

("Dating back to the Hoover Convertible, I have used various Hoover Cleaners over the years, including bagless and bagged Windtunnel models. Yes, folks have had issues with previous models, but Hoover engineers seem to have resolved those issues with this Lightweight Platinum vacuum that runs and cleans like a champ. Accompanying this upright with a separate canister is a great idea that Hoover once marketed in the 1980s with the Concept Two. I'm glad they brought this idea back. Hoover offers this Lightweight Platinum upright and canister for a price not out of line in exchange for the quality and the warranty that you get. If you buy it, you'll soon see that it's worth the investment. This is indeed the most user-friendly Windtunnel I have owned. Using is believing, and I see how easy it is to navigate around my furniture and how well it cleans and grooms my wall-to-wall carpeting on three floors. The canister does well in and of itself, but I am not too fond of the combination brush that is included. I think Hoover could have done better here. Fortunately, all of the tools that are included with a self-propelled Windtunnel that I have can be used with the canister, including the turbine tool. If you want another vacuum and can swing the purchase price, get the bagged Lightweight Platinum combo.

Days later, the smell still lingered (which would have been nice if it smelled nice).

I thought there was something wrong with the batch I bought and contemplated taking it back to the store and begging for a refund (tight budget).

Now I read that briefly Lysol was manufacturing cleaner without disinfectant. You mean the product that I used religiously to disinfect bathrooms wasn't disinfecting them at all I wish I had saved that bottle and could check to see if it had disinfectant.

Rhubarb is not my favorite honestly, I have very fair skin and very light thin lips and it just makes me look like I'm wearing too much red lipstick. Watermelon is a very nice sheer pink which looks good with almost anything I wear! Caramel is a BEAUTIFUL peachy color with a very pretty fine shimmer. Peony looks the best on me, it's a lighter pink with barely any shimmer at all but that just accentuates my natural lip color. I adore Radiance because it's such a pretty clear with lots of shimmer and it looks great! Champagne looks a lot like Radiance except it's just a tad bit pinker which is pretty. I'd love to try Guava in the near future because it looks like such a pretty pink! Another amazing product! 5 Stars BB!!!", {'entities': [(27, 38, 'PRODUCT')]})

Yummy! Your lips will love the treat of this all natural glaze of color. Your friends will ask - what lipstick do you use, it looks so natural and not painted on. You will feel and know the difference using a beauty product made by a company that always has been socially and environmentally responsible is, simply, a wonderful thing.

Please don't ever get rid of RAISIN, FIG RHUBARB as their my daily go to shades can't find any other shades or shimmers that come close to these fabulous little gems!

Also, not only do they come in beautiful colors with the perfect amount of shimmer, they also are slightly minty and very hydrating, so you get the benefit of lip balm and color all in one! My personal favorite at the moment is the shade Peony. It's been my everyday go-to lip product for almost a year now and it compliments the color of my lips so well because it is a similiar shade.

("It's a shame that I've been having so much trouble finding Burt's Bees Cocoa Lip Shimmer in supermarkets lately, because this is by far my favorite color in the set. It seems to have been replaced by Plum, which is a much more orangey-red and doesn't go to well with my skin tone... Oh well. All the lip shimmers are great products and (I think) superior alternatives to lipstick - they show up differently on everybody (skin tone seems to play an important role in this), but once you find your color, you will have a lip product with natural and understated, yet noticeable, hue. It is not nearly as thick and pasty as lipstick, and has a great mint flavor and scent which allows you to surreptitiously lick it off if need be. The Cocoa shade has a purplish-gray, almost metallic look to it when applied. It doesn't look nearly as gaudy as I'm making it sound, and the color works very well for me, a pale, dark-eyed brunette.There are a couple disadvantages to the product: It is very slick and will never dry or solidify on the lips, which means that it is just as liable to rub off onto your teeth and hands an hour after application as it is a few minutes after and something about the texture greatly enhances every flaw in the skin of your lips as you rub them together, which means that every single biteable nub that you never noticed before is going to be screaming for your attention until you take care of it. The Lip Shimmer is also stupidly expensive for less than an ounce of product, but this is Burt's Bees, after all. Overall, if you are an infrequent makeup wearer or not fond of lipstick for most of the obvious reasons (terrible taste/smell, gaudy shades), this is a great alternative to achieve some slightly subdued lip color - but if you are an everyday wearer, you might try to find something a little less expensive.", {'entities': [(59, 70, 'PRODUCT')]})

('To be honest, I grew up with an amazing old cast iron wood burning stove and have been pretty spoiled by its longevity and quality. I am now building my own home and needed a medium size stove for my small space. I had done my research and this Pleasant Hearth stove seemed like a good fit. I took careful note of the measurements because my husband and I wanted a firebox big enough for medium to large pieces of wood. We have NOT tested the stove yet as it is still summer, however, just on first inspection, it had some issues...When we went to pick up the stove, a forklift brought it over to our car on what turned out to be a broken (crushed to pieces!) pallet so that when we drove it over an hour to our house, it leaned frighteningly in the back. We would have asked for a different pallet but the stove itself was screwed to what was left of one of the slats. Fortunately, none of the legs were bent.When we got the stove home and unwrapped it, I was SHOCKED at how small the actual firebox opening is! PLEASE NOTE: the picture online and on the box of the stove is seriously misleading: the picture shows a huge glowing fire behind a lovely glass door. In reality, the glass door is way bigger than where you actually stick the wood in so when you are looking at your nice glowing fire, you only really see a small narrow section of it.Another issue that has yet to be seriously tested is the spot welding all over the stove. The big stove I grew up with is welded all around very securely. This Pleasant Hearth stove has all of these weird little spots of welding here and there that I \'m concerned may not stand the test of time.My last major issue with this stove is the coiled wire handles that come with it. There are two of them and the instructions say they should "screw on" easily. NOT the case!

The cushions are pretty comfortable actually. The chair is SUPER easy to put together. If you're mechanically inclined you can do it yourself. Others may need assistance from a second person. Fairly easy to wipe down the fabric (covers are not removable). I have fallen asleep in it with my daughter in my arms prior to the squeaking issue starting, so it is really a fairly comfortable chair. What I didn't like: 6-12 weeks after I purchased this chair I started to have a lot of squeaking coming from the bottom bearings of the gliding portion of the chair. This might not be a huge deal for some people, but it's very loud. Especially, loud when you're trying to nurse a sleepy baby back to sleep and it keeps waking them up. I tried to adjust all of the bolts, tried WD-40, didn't fix the issue. I finally contacted customer service at Storkcraft after about 7 months of owning it. They did agree to send me a replacement base for the chair since it was still within the 12 month warranty period. Oh, and I am of normal height and weight, so being over a weight limit is not an issue. Upon receipt I removed the old base, attached the new base exactly as the instructions stated. Again, about 8 weeks after receiving this base I had the same problem. I let it go for about 12 weeks and contacted Storkcraft again just to let them know I was having issues again (even though I was now out of the warranty period). They said that they would as a courtesy send me another base, but any future bases would be at a charge to me. Which of course makes sense. I told them I wasn't expecting another base, just trying to inform them that the problem was not resolved and that maybe there's an issue with the production of the item. I have received the third base (second replacement) and have not installed it yet. I would like to say that this would be a good chair if it didn't have this obnoxious squeaking issue.

I ordered a real one from Mario Badescu website, thinking the one I ordered for Amazon was fake. I was pissed thinking Amazon ripped me off. I have been using Mario's products for about a year now, religiously. When I noticed the bottle looked different and the soap smelled a little bit more lemony, I was going to write a horrible review. When the actual soap came from the website, I noticed that it was exactly the same. It smelled the same, and they just changed the bottle. I didn't return it and I felt silly. I now kept it for a re-up for when I am done with it. Do not be worried that this product isn't real, it is. I guarantee it!", {'entities': [(31, 44, 'PRODUCT')]})
("Mario Badescu is more expensive than regular drugstore brands, but this Glycolic cleanser is only about 15 for 6 oz., which is much cheaper than higher end cleansers I have used (such as Uriage Hysac, which I love enough to recite vows to, but cannot afford!!!).I use this as a clarifying cleanser in place of my regular cleanser once a week, just to really get deep into my pores and target acne. It is not recommended to use it more than three times a week, just because Glycolic Acid can be irritating for sensitive skin. People with dry or sensitive skin should use it 1-2 times a week, and people with oily or very acne-prone skin can try 2-3 times just start off using it less frequently and build up to see what works for your skin type.Honestly, I don't use this foaming cleanser frequently enough to have major beef with it. It foams up nicely and a little goes a loooong way. I'm pretty sure I'll be using this bottle for the next ten years LOL! It is a clear, yellowish gel that is rather runny. You should rub it between wet hands or a wet washcloth for a few seconds until the lather forms (it is runny, not foamy like shaving cream) and gently massage it into your wet face for a minute. Then, wash offdon't forget a cold water rinse at the end!and pat your face dry. Always follow with your regular toner and moisturizer, as this can be very drying! It makes my face slightly red right after usage, but that's expected due to the high Glycolic Acid content. I use it at night only anyway, so it's not that big of a deal. If you use it in the daytime, you should wait until the redness dies down, or cover your face with a good SPF to protect the irritation.I have an affinity for gel cleansers because they are perfect for oily skin.Read more", {'entities': [(0, 13, 'PRODUCT')]})

I was always taught not to put detergent directly on my clothes, so my normal routine is to put clothes into already-soapy water. I watched and waited after putting in the pods (both loads) and it took a long time to dissolve. Even after the casing dissolved, the detergent didn't get very soapy. The pods did get the job done. Our clothes came out clean. While I enjoy the smell of freshly cleaned clothes, I did not enjoy this particular scent (Botanical Rain). It was a strong, soapy smell.

It'd be the only detergent I'd purchase if I could afford it! I was very excited to try the Tide PODS and see what they're all about. There's a lot to love about them. The instructions are simple the PODS go directly into the laundry, saving you the trouble of measuring/spilling liquid detergent they're HE compatible and they boast an impressive 4-in-1 combination of detergent, stain remover, brightener, and Febreze. What you need to know is that they do NOT cover fabric softener, so plan on adding that to your load. Also, they work great in either warm or cold cycles, making them very convenient. I have only one complaint, but it's a big one: the fragrance didn't last through a normal dryer cycle. I was super disappointed because this was the aspect of the PODS I was most excited about. My clothes were clean, but they didn't smell fresh. I don't know about you, but when my dirty laundry is done washing and drying, I want them to SMELL clean! When I moved the load from the washer to the dryer, the fragrance was awesome. I loved it! But when I went to fold everything, it was gone. Like, 100 gone.

("I used the Tide pod that I was sent by Bzzagent for the first time last night.

The other thing that bothers me is my husband has fire safe clothing and it cannot be washed with any kind of a fabric softener, I know this has febreeze in it but it does not state of it already had a fabric softener in it so of course I cannot use this on my husband's clothes. Also after coming out of the dryer my towels did not feel as soft as they normally would after doing my regular detergent and softener, but I still used my regular fabric softener. After all the negative things I do have a couple of positives, the Tide Pods do help shave a little time off my regular laundry time since I don't have to measure out the liquid detergent. They also have a very nice smell which seems to last, my linen closet smells very nice right now. So the smell has lasted about 16 hours, which is a nice surprise since most of the time the smell fades pretty quickly. For me, the negatives outweigh the positives, plus they are more expensive than my regular liquid detergent and my detergent lasts longer than the pods do, so I probably will not purchase this on my own.

I would still buy this product, but would love to try some of the other scents as well. This review was collected as part of a promotion.", {'entities': [(0, 4, 'PRODUCT')]})

('After trying Tide Pods + Febreze Botanical Mist I was excited to have that Tide vibrant clean on my kids clothing, Tide has always been great at removing that dingy dirty look from all types of clothing. I like the Botanical Breeze small that it gives but honestly did not feel that it lasted on the clothing in the dryer. Coming out of the wash they smelled great, but after running through the dryer the fresh scent had faded a lot, so I was a little disappointed by that, and that is the only reason I did not give it a 5 star rating. Other than that, if you are looking for a detergent that can CLEAN and I mean really clean, turning dingy brown whites in to vibrant whites once again then this is the detergent for you!

I was impressed that with these all in one pods that I haven't seen the mystery greasy stains that I sometimes see on my clothes after a wash. It definitely seems to cut through the oily food and makeup type stains. My only reluctance about this product would be what about when you want to do really small loads. it seems more cost effective to have a liquid or powder in addition to your pods to do the smaller loads.

('Tide PODS Plus Febreze detergent pacs are now my favorite detergent. For some reason I thought that you could not use then on front facing machines. Glad that I was wrong. I used two for a huge color load I had to wash and super excited how clean my clothes came out. In terms of scent, while the clothes were wet they all smelled lovely and clean. After I dried them only the items that were an acrylic blend still had a noticeable Febreze scent. None of my 100 cotton clothes had a strong scent. I was looking forward to toasty warm and clean smelling clothes. I guess actually clean clothes are better than just smelling clean. I guess I wish the scent lingered more.

("I've seen and heard of similar products before but never tried them until I received the Tide pods and Febreeze packet rough BzzAgent. Apart from being thrilled that I got to wash a few loads for free, I was also intrigued as to how successful these loads would be compared to my usual liquid detergent. I've been very particular about using dye-free detergent for sensitive skin for years, as I used to have allergic reactions to other kinds of detergent. And since we have small children at home, I've gotten used to using this type of detergent so it wouldn't irritate their skin. I was skeptical and a bit hesitant to try this product, worried that one or more members of my family would have an adverse reaction to it. I was also rather skeptical regarding the effectiveness of a pre-measured pod-- what's the most use I can get out of it in a load without compromising the quality of the results Lastly, I was interested to see how it compared to our usual liquid detergent and if it would merit spending the extra money for these more expensive pods. In the end, the only way to satisfy my curiosity was to test the pods and see how much I could get out of them. And I am proud to say that none of them provoked any kind of adverse skin reaction on anyone in my family-- not necessarily what I would have expected. I definitely pushed the limits on load size to see how worthwhile these pods would be compared to being able to measure liquid detergent, and I thought each load came out very well. If it didn't clean our clothes as effectively, I couldn't tell. (Which was a relief because I wouldn't have wanted to have to re-wash those loads). Obviously, the convenience of simply throwing a pod in vs. measuring liquid was nice, though I don't know if I would pay extra for that luxury at this point. I must say, I may actually go out and buy more of the Febreeze packets, because my laundry smelled AMaZING after using it! The scent was definitely stronger after the wash than after the dryer, but I don't normally use scented freshened and it was definitely nice to use, at least once in a while. While my experience with the Tide pods was overall positive, I didn't think that the product wow-ed me enough to warrant a switch to this more expensive product when my family is already on a tight budget. The inconvenience of measuring liquid detergent can also be a plus in being able to alter amounts to match load sizes. What I will say, though, is that I would probably use this product when my kids are learning to do their laundry themselves, especially if I decide to teach them when they're a little bit younger. I would definitely pay extra to not have to worry about my kids spilling or accidentally ingesting detergent when all they would have to do is throw in s prepackaged pod instead. No mess, no worries. I give this product 4 stars simply because it would be more expensive for me to switch to this product, and I'm not looking to expand my budget when I already use a product that's just as effective.

("My boyfriend and I have the same debate weekly...how much laundry detergent to use. We are liquid detergent folks. The powdered stuff leaves streaks on the dark colors.

Which one do I use for a medium load of clothes Who decides what a medium load is anyway My definition of medium was far different than the boyfriend's. Go figure! He once put so much detergent in a small load of clothes that I had to rinse them three times to get the suds out. These Tide Pods with Febreze Botanical Mist are no fuss and take the guess work out of measuring detergent. No messy cup to rinse. And, oh my, the scent is refreshing!

These 4 in 1 pods contain detergent, stain remover, brightener, and long lasting freshness! No more struggling to carry in detergent, AND stain remover from the car, these pods have everything you need!

It was nice not having to measure out the liquid, secretly wondering if I'm using too little or too much...never REALLY knowing. All you have to do with these PODS is pop 'em in with the clothes and start your machine. SO EASY! No GUESSING GAME! And my clothes still come out amazingly clean thanks to the awesome power of Tide.

The detergent is so gentle and cloth diaper safe. It immediately turns green and blue as it releases the cleaning agent. I love seeing that. It is proof that is working. Not only that, but the added febreeze made them smell so good. It, too, was strong enough to spread throughout my whole house.

Between a growing family, a smelly dog, and multiple dirty work clothes (most of which come from my plumber husband), laundry seems like a never ending chore in my house.

This is why I was pleasantly surprised by how easy it was to use the Tide pod. I just threw it in with my clothes (no measuring required, YAY!) and pressed start. That quick... and totally fabulous. Not to mention, the scent was fresh and clean smelling. My clothes really smelled clean and I love wearing them now just for the scent!

I kept it simple and stayed with what I knew because the detergent aisle is overwhelming and we don't have it in our budget to try out detergents to see if they held up to the hype or not. Boy am I glad I was able to try these pods out! My laundry had a soft, amazing, botanical scent. I kept stopping and smelling the clothes as I transferred them from the washer to dryer. Once they were done in the dryer and I folded them, I was very happy with how clean they came out. They felt/looked so clean. There was no fading in the colors. There was no detergent build up.

("When i saw this Bzz Campaign it got my attention right away. Once I received my Bzz Kit I specifically waited for certain items to pile up in our laundry. We live in south FL and being we experience sun, sun and more sun on a daily basis, my kids are usually looking and smelling like a pig pen by the end of the day however my husband's workout and tennis clothes are always the winners in my laundry and disgustingly drenched in sweat....like I don't even want to have to touch them to load the washing machine! I figured his clothes would be the true test for these products. When washing my husband's clothes I normally have to use FOUR things during the wash cycle to get the sweat odor neutralized (the final step is usually white vinegar as my fabric softener!) so the clothes don't even come out smelling particularly pretty, but they just don't reek like they did before being washed. This time I only used the Tide Pods + Botanical Mist as my detergent along with the Downy Fresh Protect Beads Botanical Mist . I was skeptical at first thinking there was no way these 2 items alone could do the job when i'm normally doing a 4 product process. I was anxious to open my washer when the cycle had finished and see how the products held up against the smelly clothes. To my complete surprise, I opened the washer door and was immediately hit with this very pleasant aroma.....Botanical Mist! I seriously could have sniffed my laundry all day!

The PODS are so easy to use, and it takes out all of the guess-work (how much detergent should I really use) and ALL of the mess!

The scent was perfect, not too strong or too light. I noticed a nice light scent 5 days after the laundry was done. That's 5x longer than my regular detergent.

The Tide Pods had no problem at all taking care of the stains, when I usually have to pre-treat with a separate stain remover.

I kept going back to smell it because it's really that good. Its fresh and crisp, but light. My whole bedroom smelled clean. I'd recommend these based on scent alone! These little premeasured individual pods, are so convenient and easy to use. One for a regular load, 2 for a bigger one, you can't mess it up. I used these on a few blankets, which was about a double load, so I used both. Just throw them in add the laundry and start. That's it! What's also great about them is that there is no required temperature or wash setting. They will dissolve in cold, warm or hot water. They also clean really well. I've been a life long user of a different detergent, so I was honestly shocked at how clean it got my sons blanket(it's his lovey, he carries..or drags it everywhere it gets pretty gross). It was the cleanest I've seen it in a long time, my usual detergent leaves it pretty dingy. Not tide though, I might have a new detergent!

('I was pretty skeptical of the Tide PODS with Febreze. We have a pool and the beach towels get used often. Sometimes they get dry between uses and sometimes they end up in a stinky pile. When that happens they get that sour mildewy smell. I have tried washing in very hot water and other smell enhancing products, but the sour smell always comes through unless I use bleach. The bleach just ruins the pretty and bright colors of the towels. I was so surprised when I took my load of towels out of the washer and gave them a sniff test. The Tide PODS with Febreze had my towels smelling clean. I gave another test after drying with the same great results. I am convinced that this is the right product for our family when it comes to keeping our towels fresh and clean!!

I like my bath towels to smell fresh for the entire week after its first use. By day 3-4 you could already tell it wasn't a fresh towel.

Especially if I had borrowed a shirt, which my mom had washed and I was then returning it. This made me proud and I never forgot. Therefore, I never thought twice about which brand of detergent to use once I was out on my own, and I've never been disappointed. However I was pleasantly surprised at how easy the pods were to use!! They were mess free and quick to just throw in the wash. They worked wonderfully. They cleaned well and smelled great.

Personally I've always been more of a fan of powdered detergent, but the concept of just tossing in a pod to get detergent and softener in one load was great since I didn't have to measure anything. I tried the Gain Original Flings detergent pacs and Tide PODS Plus Febreze detergent pacs in Botanical Rain. Both of them had very fresh smelling scents. I preferred the smell of the Tide PODS Plus Febreze detergent pacs in Botanical Rain, but the Gain Originals Flings scent actually stayed on the load of laundry after running it through the dryer. Pro's: Convenience of not having to measure laundry detergent and softener Smells great Saves time Con's: More expensive than traditional detergent and softener Pre-measured for a full load of laundry and many times I do not have a full load so it becomes wasteful Automatically comes with a fabric softener and I prefer not to use that on my toddler's clothes I would purchase these products in the future if I had coupons and/or they were running a great sale on them, but I see myself saving them for full loads of laundry such as towels sheets.

We did two loads of laundry with the Tide Pods prior to packing. Not only were we greeting with clean and fresh scented clothing when we opened our luggage at our destination, but we were also very surprised to find that the clothes that did not come on our trip with us also still smelled as fresh as they did when the laundry was first completed! I actually put on my pants and made my husband smell them to confirm! When wearing the clothes that had been washed with the Tide Pods, I could smell the clean scent throughout the day. I was concerned that perhaps the scent might be too strong for others, but when I told my friends and family about it, none of them seemed to think that it was too strong. I was also concerned that perhaps my toddler son might have a skin reaction to the detergent, if the scent was so strong, but so far, that has not been the case. My toddler has very mild dry skin on occasion, so we tend to use sensitive, scent free or lightly scented products for his clothing.

("I have an extra large washer (4.3 cubic feet) and I was worried that one little pod would not be enough for one of my LARGE loads. Boy was I in for a shock. Not only did this little thing clean everything efficiently, but somehow they managed to pack a whole lot of scent in this tiny pod. The smell is not over powering, but it's strong enough to breathe in as you pull your laundry out of the dryer, and it sticks to the garments long after they've been washed! My California King down alternative comforter still smells amazing even though it's been two weeks since I last washed it. And the best part is ONE POD got it sparkling white again. I do have to add softener to the wash still (it's not a part of the pods - which if you have anyone in your family who has eczema, this is a GOOD thing!) but that's perfectly fine with me. If you have a front loader (I used to, but I went back to top loading after a while) and you have problems with mildew in the door, it could be caused from using TOO MUCH SOAP which leaves soap scum in the rubber seal of the door, and allows mildew to grow on it. This happens frequently if you use soap that is NOT made for an H.E. washer!! I had this problem with our front loader (which is part of the reason we went back to top loading when we bought our new washer). These pods however, help prevent that. They're made for H.E. machines AND they only give as much soap as needed, no matter the load size - I think this has a lot to do with how easily the soap inside of them breaks down in the wash. They work well if you're using all cold water or all hot water or a mix of the two. I haven't found a reason to complain about these yet!! With every load I've ever done I always use softener in the wash AND a dryer sheet in the dryer. I followed the same routine with the pods (softener in the wash, dryer sheet in the dryer) and I still say the scent with the pods is STRONGER than it has ever been with regular detergent. I love, love, love these little pods!! I am hooked for life!! I can't wait to try the other scents Tide offers!

("Ok, so I was super stoked when I recieved this particular Bzz Kit as I'm a huge laundry fanatic. I'll start by saying, I'm a religous Gain user and am really big on scent as well. I do at least 5-8 loads of laundry each week, including bedding and towels. I've used Tide in the past and while it works ok, I never found it to be the very best and preferred the smell of Gain. I did my first small load, brights, with one Tide Pod, and was pleasantly surprised. I specifically chose brights so I could see if there really was a difference. After finishing my first load, the scent was better than any Tide I've previously used, but I really noticed a difference in the look of the laundry. The clothes, overall, looked a more vibrant after the wash. The colors were actually brighter and the stains... GONE! The load was made up predominantly of my 6 year old daughters clothes, as they easily get the dirtiest. I did NO pre-treatment of the stains on her shirts (koolaid, brownish who knows what, food, drinks and I dare not guess the rest) and was able to get most stains to disappear using only the Tide Pod. I also didn't notice any kind of skin reaction on any of the household members leading me to believe the detergent itself is fairly gentle and enjoyed the addition of the Febreeze scent as well. While I wouldn't give it 1, I would definitely say it's a close 2nd in the wide world of laundry. Overall, this item did a great job of cleaning and brightening the clothes. I personally would recommend this laundry detergent if you're looking to get a good overall clean, good/lasting scent, and/or brighter clothes.

("Last night I curled up in bed in my recently laundered sheets using Tide Pods + Febreze Botanical Mist and was struck by the amazing difference from washing with my regular detergent. I will start with the fresh scent - it is really nice. Not overpowering, not smelling like perfume or chemicals. It was just right. In addition to the wonderful scent, the laundry was nicely soft, and well cleaned. I had a few spots on some of the clothes that came off nicely. There was no detergent detergent residue on the clothing which I have sometimes experienced with other detergents. There was no static in the laundry when I removed it from the dryer. Using the Tide Pods + Febreze Botanical Mist couldn't be easier. They come in individual capsules that contain both detergent and fabric softener. The pod capsule dissolves in the water during laundry. The pre-made capsule was extremely simple to use - no measurement required. And the results were outstanding. I highly recommend the Tide Pods + Febreze Botanical Mist for the simplicity of use and great results. This review was collected as part of a promotion.", {'entities': [(68, 72, 'PRODUCT')]})

My bed sheets came out smelling so good and fresh I could not wait to go to bed that night. I have used regular Tide before, but I think I will be switching to the PODs. The Pods seem to be easier than pouring the detergent out. Also, when my mom stopped over while i was washing my bed sheets, she said my house smelled amazing.

I was very impressed by the smell of the clothing when I opened the washing machine. They smelled so fresh! I was always worried that the pod wouldn't break correctly and would get all over my clothes in a bad way. I'm happy to say that didn't happen both times I used them! Once I dried the clothes is when I was really impressed. Stains that I thought were impossible to remove were now gone and the good smell didn't go away! They were always super easy to use! I didn't have to measure anything out and pour in. All I had to do was throw the whole pod in with my clothes and start my machine which is wonderful when I have a crying baby at my legs.

They are so quick and easy to drop into a load of laundry - no measuring necessary and no spilling! It has left my laundry bright and clean along with smelling fantastic and soo fresh. The scent seems to stay longer than regular liquid detergent. The pods are color safe and did not fade the colors and at the same time it made the white more brighter.

While the cycle was going I could smell the loveliness of the Febreze which was very pleasant.

Grass stains, history. Mud, banished. Tide has always been one of my favorite brands, but what I absolutely adore about these pods is there is no waste.

Brightens Yes. I have a lot of light colored clothes and sometimes they can look a little lifeless from all the washes they go through, specially right after drying i can usually see them fade a bit more, but with this pac i didn't see the color any less faded and some even looked better. Fights stains Yes. I tried this pac on my white pair of jeans that had a dark little grass stain on them and it took it off completely!

When I first got my BzzAgent kit I first was anticipating a pod the size of a dishwasher tab. But I was clearly wrong. The TidePods were really large and most importantly they did the job for a regular size load. They're very easy to use, just pop it directly into the washer and no need to measure anything out like you would for liquid or powder detergent.

No fumbling around with messy measuring caps. Just pop one in the machine, and you're ready to go! And the fact that they can be used in either HE or non HE machines and with hot OR cold water is awesome! The only thing that I had a question on is load size. So I tried the second one out on a half sized load, and saw no real difference in performance. I assume to get the most bang for your buck, you should use them with a full load. But there was no harm in using one for a smaller load size. When I stopped in to Target to pick up more, they didn't have the Botanical Mist scent. So I picked up the regular Tide PODS.

It came out smelling Okay (not like the way I like with either Tide with Downy April Fresh or Tide Clean Breeze or dare I say it Gain Original although it is also a PG brand had to throw it in there because its cheaper than Tide and does just about as good of a job and I love the smell too.) However--- for those who make a mess with powder and liquid detergents like my parents and my sister. (liquid can leak all over the side of the bottle and powder and liquid both can be split then you waste product) Toss it in and no product waste and no mess.

Apparently, the pod is supposed to go into the washer (I have a front loader) before adding the clothes.

So, I guess I am technically to blame however, if there is even a chance that staining would occur, I really feel as if there should be a warning on the box.

To be sure, the Pod concept and design is new in and of itself, but a laundry detergent in a compact, self contained form is not. Back in the 1960's, there were detergent tablets, such as Salvo and Action bleach. They didn't stay on the market very long, or that is what I remember. Even 10 years ago, PG introduced, then quickly pulled Tide Rapid Action Tablets. So even though the cleaning ability of Pods is consistent with most other PG detergents (which is my universal choice) I can not say with certainty that this is a fantastic, revolutionary product that has exceptional cleaning prowess.

I don't sort by colors, and wash everything together in cold water. The Tide Pod was up against a formidable foe. First impressions: The Pod is really neat (in both cleanliness and tactile feeling). It feels almost like a delicate bath bead. They smell nice and light, but not overly similar to other Tide products I have smelled before. Washing results: My normal clothes looked, smelled, and felt clean after washing with the Tide Pod. The mysterious stains on the yellow shirt had disappeared, which particularly impressed me! The blue tank top, however, was still dingy and dull. My clothes smelled noticeably fresh (the smell is very faint, which in my opinion is a good thing, as strong scents can make me sneeze a lot).

I always dissolve a pod fully in a cup of hot water and then add it to the laundry water. Then I add the clothes. There are no problems after that.

Where I may purchase the Tide with color safe bleach HE Original I have yet to see it in the stores and have been adding another HE colorsafe bleach into my Tide HE Detergent for my loads that need the boost. (Whites that cannot be bleached, etc) A helpful tip about front load washers: My machine just happens to have a very convenient specific cycle used to periodically clean the washer. This works great and so my washer remains fresh/ brand new. If your HE washer does not have this feature then you will simply need to run an empty cycle through with just bleach (no detergent), wipe down your machine and leave your door open to air out.

('I have always had better results with Tide products starting with the powder, then the liquid when it was first introduced. Since I have had excellent results with the similar new dishwasher pacs that are now available, I decided to give Tide Pods a try. Very glad I did. They work as advertised with much less mess. I have not experienced problems with the Pods dissolving or spotting clothes that a few of the reviewers have mentioned. The Pods work as advertised for me when stored properly and thrown into the bottom of the drum before the clothes. I have always had a tendency to overuse detergents which is one reason that I wanted to try the Pods. One Pod seems to be perfect in my front-loading HE washer. I started with Ocean Mist which seems to have the least fragrance (I prefer free detergents). Hard to detect any scent in the clothes at all, but this might be because we always use the extra rinse feature of our washer. End result: I think Tide Pods clean better than Tide liquid. A perfect example is my work/fishing hat - talk about a greasy, sweaty and dirty mess at the end of a week of fishing. In the past I have always had to pre-treat it. Well I forgot, and threw it in with all the other fishing clothes and towels that we use on the boat.

My mother would help me take of my back pack, sit me down on the couch, then go into the bathroom. She would come back out with a brand new Quilted Northern toilet paper roll, hand it to me, and simply say, tell me about it. Sometimes I would sit there, unable to speak only able to unroll the first few soft, beautifully-designed squares.

On a near-weekly basis, my mother would have words of comfort, reassurance, and love for me.

All the bullying could have torn me apart, ruining me for life. Thank heavens for a mother like mine, and a simple roll of toilet paper.

To their credit, this site has replaced one set of the new containers for me but not all I purchased. The new ones seem to work a bit better but the seals are still unreliable. I am not a novice. I keep the seals and valve clean, I have never put them in the dishwasher and in fact, always wash the lids by hand and never immerse them. I have been forced to check the seals regularly and reseal often - not what I bargained for. I have had some luck by rotating the lids to find, perhaps, if there is one rotation that seals better and then placing a small mark with permanent marker to help me use the placement that might seem to hold the seal longer. I swear some of these lids in the early manufacturing runs are warped. Sometimes I can rotate the lids to find a placement that doesn't pop up but those warped lids are hopeless and I just boxed them up and put them out in the shed until I figure a fix. (I used to help the marinator seal with a bit of vegetable oil on the seal and that seemed to help keep them sealed a bit longer but who knows. When I press them on, I can feel them pop back up - no wonder they don't seal reliably. Some are not warped. Occasionally, they will surprise me and hold the seal for a longer period but I still can count on them and must constantly go to the pantry to check to make sure my saltines or pastas are still sealed so that they don't go rancid on me too quickly but I am running out of counter space for those containers that seem to require daily re-sealing or in some cases, every six hours or so. I have tried to determine if these new containers work better in the fridge or out and they remain non-reliable for the most part no matter the environmental conditions.

("I love the Foodsaver sealer but sometimes I want access the sealed items and seal them back up without wasting bags. These containers are the perfect solution. They are very easy to use and very obviously show if the container is sealed right on the lid. The sealing function is quite obvious, plug and seal, and takes just a few seconds. I appreciate the multiple sizes of the containers as they are large enough to fit almost every need. In my fridge they did take up a decent amount of room so I'm not sure I'd use them often for long term fridge storage. I do use them frequently for pantry storage (crackers/cookies) and freezer storage (cookies/scones). The clear containers allow you to easily see what is inside. As much as I appreciate the storage aspect I do have to say that the microwave usage surprised me. They performed great in the microwave, the food warmed and the container did not! I was shocked. Clean up was a breeze too, even spaghetti sauce left for days did not stain these containers. You can pop them into the dishwasher and they clean right up. The only negative I can think of is that the vacuum valve cover is a little difficult to remove, I wish they had added a little grab tab or something to assist in removing. But since you only remove this to clean the top lid, I suppose its a minor inconvenience. Disclaimer: I received this product free as an advance sample in exchange for a detailed and honest review.

("Foodsaver vacuum storage containers are definitely a money saving value. They are easy to use with the Foodsaver vacuum unit, and as I was asked to try these with different foods in different situations including microwaving and dishwashing they thoroughly kept my food fresh and cooked without staining or breaking. I'm looking forward to trying many different foods with the storage containers, since they seal easily and have kept food fresh remarkably over the last few weeks. I tried putting salad mix in the large 10-cup container and remarkably it stayed much fresher than the unsealed bag I got from the store. I tried it in the freezer and in the refrigerator with both leftovers and deli products in it. Great products, great value. I received this as a sample to try but would definitely purchase it without question. This review was collected as part of a promotion.", {'entities': [(0, 9, 'PRODUCT')]})

("I added this to my growing number of Foodsaver containers a couple of weeks ago and it exceeded my high expectations. The new containers seem sturdier than my previous ones. With only two of us, berries especially get soft and are thrown out. With the first use and filling it to the max with strawberries, not one was discarded. With daily use and resealing after each use, the berries stayed firm. Green beans did just as well. My 5 cup container does just as well with blueberries or anything else I have tried.

("Do NOT purchase Oxy's new product if you have bad acne or are sensitive to lotions/oils that clog your pores easily! The ingredients listed on the Amazon listing do NOT reflect what is on my bottle I purchased at the store, which includes butyrospermum parkii (shea butter) fruit. Why in the world would any product treating acne of any kind put shea butter in it! I suffered with acne my whole life and when I turned 40 I developed horrible cystic acne. Proactiv no longer worked for me so I switched to Oxy. I've since changed my diet drastically and the cystic acne is gone. But I continued using Oxy which made my skin almost a 100 clear. Not too long ago they changed the formula for the Spot Treatment and it had some sort of fragrance in it, which I hated because my skin is extremenly sensitive and breaks out easily with fragrance products. Despite that change, I continued using Oxy. Now with the change of the Face Wash I will discontinue using their products. My face was breaking out all over and I couldn't figure out why.

("I love this cleanser! I used to have pretty skin growing up but despite that I would bounce from product to product because I wanted flawless. I am not saying this product makes my skin flawless but it has tremendously helped with the breakouts I have had over the past few months. I am 23 and have combination skin and I was starting to break out like crazy due to stress and just my skin! I was so upset and felt ugly. I felt like I was constantly putting pounds of makeup on my face. I started using this cleanser and the Oxy Daily Defense Cleansing pads. The past week has been dramatic. I was just going to give the product the typical two weeks and then try to move on. But since I have been using this, my breakouts have decreased. The cleanser doesn't have an overpowering smell. It can be used as a mask and it is actually pretty good with my Olay facial brush. I really recommend this product because it can be used so many ways and it does a fantastic job! CAUTION: It does bleach what you dry your face with! Make sure to use a towel you don't care about.UPDATE: I made a mistake! I tried to change up my routine and use something else. I used Philosophy purity gel cleanser which seemed to be fine for a couple of days and then the breakouts started again! I am now back on Oxy. My 15 year old brother has massive acne breakouts on his T-Zone, massive whiteheads and cystic acne. After watching him struggle, I recommended he use this with the daily cleansing pads. He has been using it almost 2 weeks and his acne has MASSIVELY improved! My mom has been going through breakouts with her new medication and now is going to try it as well.
